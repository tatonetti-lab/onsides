[see clinical pharmacology (12.3)] since the blood pressure in pediatric patients, particularly infants and neonates, is sensitive to changes in heart rate, the effects of an anticholinergic agent (e.g., atropine) should be observed prior to administration of neostigmine to lessen the probability of bradycardia and hypotension.",

pharmacokinetics of busulfan in 24 pediatric patients receiving busulfan as part of a conditioning regimen administered prior to hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation for a variety of malignant hematologic (n=15) or non-malignant diseases (n=9). patients ranged in age from 5 months to 16 years (median 3 years). busulfan dosing was targeted to achieve an area under the plasma concentration curve (auc) of 900-1350 \u03bcm\u2022min with an initial dose of 0.8 mg per kg or 1.0 mg per kg (based on actual body weight (abw)) if the patient was greater than 4 or less than or equal to 4 years, respectively. the dose was adjusted based on plasma concentration after completion of dose 1. patients received busulfan doses every six hours as a two-hour infusion over four days for a total of 16 doses, followed by cyclophosphamide 50 mg per kg once daily for four days. after one rest day, hematopoietic progenitor cells were infused. all patients received phenytoin as seizure prophylaxis. the target auc (900-1350\u00b15% \u03bcm\u2022min) for busulfan was achieved at dose 1 in 71% (17/24) of patients. steady state pharmacokinetic testing was performed at dose 9 and 13. busulfan levels were within the target range for 21 of 23 evaluable patients. all 24 patients experienced neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (anc) less than 0.5\u00d7109/l) and thrombocytopenia (platelet transfusions or platelet count less than 20,000/mm3). seventy-nine percent (19/24) of patients experienced lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count less than 0.1\u00d7109). in 23 patients, the anc recovered to greater than 0.5\u00d7109/l (median time to recovery = bmt day +13; range = bmt day +9 to +22). one patient who died on day +20 had not recovered to an anc >0.5\u00d7109/l. four (17%) patients died during the study. two patients died within 28 days of transplant; one with pneumonia and capillary leak syndrome, and the other with pneumonia and veno-occlusive disease. two patients died prior to day 100; one due to progressive disease and one due to multi-organ failure. adverse reactions were reported in all 24 patients during the study period (bmt day -10 through bmt day +28) or post-study surveillance period (day +29 through +100). these included vomiting (100%), nausea (83%), stomatitis (79%), hvod (21%), graft-versus host disease (gvhd) (25%), and pneumonia (21%). based on the results of this 24-patient clinical trial, a suggested dosing regimen of busulfan in pediatric patients is shown in the following dosing nomogram: busulfan dosing nomogram patient's actual body weight (abw) busulfan dosage less than or equal to12 kg 1.1 (mg per kg) greater than 12 kg 0.8 (mg per kg) simulations based on a pediatric population pharmacokinetic model indicate that approximately 60% of pediatric patients will achieve a target busulfan exposure (auc) between 900 to 1350 \u03bcm\u2022min with the \ufb01rst dose of busulfan using this dosing nomogram. therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment following the \ufb01rst dose of busulfan is recommended. dose adjustment based on therapeutic drug monitoring instructions for measuring the auc of busulfan at dose 1 (see blood sample collection for auc determination ) and the formula for adjustment of subsequent doses to achieve the desired target auc (1125 \u00b5m\u2022min), are provided below. adjusted dose (mg) = actual dose (mg) x target auc (\u03bcm\u2022min)/actual auc (\u03bcm\u2022min) for example, if a patient received a dose of 11 mg busulfan and if the corresponding auc measured was 800 \u00b5m\u2022min, for a target auc of 1125 \u00b5m\u2022min, the target mg dose would be: mg dose =11 mg x 1125 \u03bcm\u2022min /800 \u03bcm\u2022min =15.5 mg busulfan dose adjustment may be made using this formula and instructions below. blood sample collection for auc determination calculate the auc (\u00b5m\u2022min) based on blood samples collected at the following time points: for dose 1:2 hr (end of infusion), 4 hr and 6 hr (immediately prior to the next scheduled busulfan administration). actual sampling times should be recorded. for doses other than dose 1: pre-infusion (baseline), 2 hr (end of infusion), 4 hr and 6 hr (immediately prior to the next scheduled busulfan administration). auc calculations based on fewer than the three specified samples may result in inaccurate auc determinations. for each scheduled blood sample, collect one to three ml of blood into heparinized (na or li heparin) vacutainer\u00ae tubes. the blood samples should be placed on wet ice immediately after collection and should be centrifuged (at 4\u00b0c) within one hour. the plasma, harvested into appropriate cryovial storage tubes, is to be frozen immediately at -20\u00b0c. all plasma samples are to be sent in a frozen state (i.e., on dry ice) to the assay laboratory for the determination of plasma busulfan concentrations. calculation of auc busulfan auc calculations may be made using the following instructions and appropriate standard pharmacokinetic formula: dose 1 aucinfinity calculation: aucinfinity = auc0\u20136hr +aucextrapolated, where auc0\u20136hr is to be estimated using the linear trapezoidal rule and auc extrapolated can be computed by taking the ratio of the busulfan concentration at hour 6 and the terminal elimination rate constant, \u03bbz. the \u03bbz must be calculated from the terminal elimination phase of the busulfan concentration vs. time curve. a \"0\" pre-dose busulfan concentration should be assumed, and used in the calculation of auc. if the auc is assessed subsequent to dose 1, steady-state aucss (auc0\u20136hr) is to be estimated from the trough, 2 hr, 4 hr and 6 hr concentrations using the linear trapezoidal rule. instructions for drug administration and blood sample collection for therapeutic drug monitoring use an administration set with minimal residual hold up (priming) volume (1- to 3 ml) for drug infusion to ensure accurate delivery of the entire prescribed dose and to ensure accurate collection of blood samples for therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment. prime the administration set tubing with drug solution to allow accurate documentation of the start time of busulfan infusion. collect the blood sample from a peripheral iv line to avoid contamination with infusing drug. if the blood sample is taken directly from the existing central venous catheter (cvc), do not collect the blood sample while the drug is infusing to ensure that the end of infusion sample is not contaminated with any residual drug. at the end of infusion (2 hr), disconnect the administration tubing and \ufb02ush the cvc line with 5 ml of normal saline prior to the collection of the end of infusion sample from the cvc port. collect the blood samples from a different port than that used for the busulfan infusion. when recording the busulfan infusion stop time, do not include the time required to \ufb02ush the indwelling catheter line. discard the administration tubing at the end of the two-hour infusion\u00a0[see dosage and administration (2.3) ].",

        "section_text": "the effectiveness of busulfan injection in the treatment of cml has not been specifically studied in pediatric patients. an open-label, uncontrolled study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of busulfan injection in 24 pediatric patients receiving busulfan injection as part of a conditioning regimen administered prior to hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation for a variety of malignant hematologic (n = 15) or non-malignant diseases (n = 9). patients ranged in age from 5 months to 16 years (median 3 years). busulfan injection dosing was targeted to achieve an area under the plasma concentration curve (auc) of 900 to 1350 \u03bcm\u2022min with an initial dose of 0.8 mg per kg or 1.0 mg per kg (based on actual body weight (abw)) if the patient was greater than 4 or less than or equal to 4 years, respectively. the dose was adjusted based on plasma concentration after completion of dose 1. patients received busulfan injection doses every six hours as a two-hour infusion over four days for a total of 16 doses, followed by cyclophosphamide 50 mg per kg once daily for four days. after one rest day, hematopoietic progenitor cells were infused. all patients received phenytoin as seizure prophylaxis. the target auc (900 to 1350 \u00b1 5% \u03bcm\u2022min) for busulfan injection was achieved at dose 1 in 71% (17/24) of patients. steady state pharmacokinetic testing was performed at dose 9 and 13. busulfan injection levels were within the target range for 21 of 23 evaluable patients. all 24 patients experienced neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (anc) less than 0.5 x 109/l) and thrombocytopenia (platelet transfusions or platelet count less than 20,000/mm3). seventy-nine percent (19/24) of patients experienced lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count less than 0.1 x 109). in 23 patients, the anc recovered to greater than 0.5 x 109/l (median time to recovery = bmt day +13; range = bmt day +9 to +22). one patient who died on day +20 had not recovered to an anc > 0.5 x 109/l. four (17%) patients died during the study. two patients died within 28 days of transplant; one with pneumonia and capillary leak syndrome, and the other with pneumonia and veno-occlusive disease. two patients died prior to day 100; one due to progressive disease and one due to multi-organ failure. adverse reactions were reported in all 24 patients during the study period (bmt day -10 through bmt day +28) or post-study surveillance period (day +29 through +100). these included vomiting (100%), nausea (83%), stomatitis (79%), hvod (21%), graft-versus host disease (gvhd) (25%), and pneumonia (21%). based on the results of this 24-patient clinical trial, a suggested dosing regimen of busulfan injection in pediatric patients is shown in the following dosing nomogram: busulfan injection dosing nomogram patient's actual body weight (abw) busulfan injection dosage less than or equal to 12 kgs 1.1 (mg per kg) greater than 12 kgs 0.8 (mg per kg) simulations based on a pediatric population pharmacokinetic model indicate that approximately 60% of pediatric patients will achieve a target busulfan injection exposure (auc) between 900 to 1350 \u03bcm\u2022min with the first dose of busulfan injection using this dosing nomogram. therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment following the first dose of busulfan injection is recommended. dose adjustment based on therapeutic drug monitoring instructions for measuring the auc of busulfan at dose 1 (see blood sample collection for auc determination) and the formula for adjustment of subsequent doses to achieve the desired target auc (1125 \u03bcm\u2022min), are provided below. adjusted dose (mg) = actual dose (mg) x target auc (\u03bcm\u2022min)/actual auc (\u03bcm\u2022min) for example, if a patient received a dose of 11 mg busulfan and if the corresponding auc measured was 800 \u03bcm\u2022min, for a target auc of 1125 \u03bcm\u2022min, the target mg dose would be: mg dose = 11 mg x 1125 \u03bcm\u2022min /800 \u03bcm\u2022min = 15.5 mg busulfan injection dose adjustment may be made using this formula and instructions below. blood sample collection for auc determination calculate the auc (\u03bcm\u2022min) based on blood samples collected at the following time points: for dose 1:2 hr (end of infusion), 4 hr and 6 hr (immediately prior to the next scheduled busulfan injection administration). actual sampling times should be recorded. for doses other than dose 1: pre-infusion (baseline), 2 hr (end of infusion), 4 hr and 6 hr (immediately prior to the next scheduled busulfan injection administration). auc calculations based on fewer than the three specified samples may result in inaccurate auc determinations. for each scheduled blood sample, collect one to three ml of blood into heparinized (na or li heparin) vacutainer\u00ae tubes. the blood samples should be placed on wet ice immediately after collection and should be centrifuged (at 4\u00b0c) within one hour. the plasma, harvested into appropriate cryovial storage tubes, is to be frozen immediately at -20\u00b0c. all plasma samples are to be sent in a frozen state (i.e., on dry ice) to the assay laboratory for the determination of plasma busulfan concentrations. calculation of auc busulfan injection auc calculations may be made using the following instructions and appropriate standard pharmacokinetic formula: dose 1 aucinfinity calculation: aucinfinity = auc0-6hr + aucextrapolated, where auc0-6hr is to be estimated using the linear trapezoidal rule and auc extrapolated can be computed by taking the ratio of the busulfan concentration at hour 6 and the terminal elimination rate constant, \u03bbz. the \u03bbz must be calculated from the terminal elimination phase of the busulfan concentration vs. time curve. a \u201c0\u201d pre-dose busulfan concentration should be assumed, and used in the calculation of auc. if the auc is assessed subsequent to dose 1, steady-state aucss (auc0-6hr) is to be estimated from the trough, 2 hr, 4 hr and 6 hr concentrations using the linear trapezoidal rule. instructions for drug administration and blood sample collection for therapeutic drug monitoring use an administration set with minimal residual hold up (priming) volume (1 to 3 ml) for drug infusion to ensure accurate delivery of the entire prescribed dose and to ensure accurate collection of blood samples for therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment. prime the administration set tubing with drug solution to allow accurate documentation of

different port than that used for the busulfan injection infusion. when recording the busulfan injection infusion stop time, do not include the time required to flush the indwelling catheter line. discard the administration tubing at the end of the two-hour infusion [see dosage and administration (2.3)].",

        "section_text": "pimecrolimus cream, 1% is not indicated for use in children less than 2 years of age. the long-term safety and effects of pimecrolimus cream, 1% on the developing immune system are unknown. three phase 3 pediatric trials were conducted involving 1114 subjects 2-17 years of age. two trials were 6-week randomized vehicle-controlled trials with a 20-week open-label phase and one was a vehicle-controlled (up to 1 year) safety trial with the option for sequential topical corticosteroid use. of these subjects, 542 (49%) were 2-6 years of age. in the short-term trials, 11% of pimecrolimus subjects did not complete these trials and 1.5% of pimecrolimus subjects discontinued due to adverse events. in the 1-year trial, 32% of pimecrolimus subjects did not complete this trial and 3% of pimecrolimus subjects discontinued due to adverse events. most discontinuations were due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. the most common local adverse event in the short-term trials of pimecrolimus cream, 1% in pediatric subjects ages 2-17 was application site burning (10% vs. 13% vehicle); the incidence in the long-term trial was 9% pimecrolimus vs. 7% vehicle [see\u00a0adverse reactions (6.1)]. adverse events that were more frequent (>5%) in subjects treated with pimecrolimus cream, 1% compared to vehicle were headache (14% vs. 9%) in the short-term trial. nasopharyngitis (26% vs. 21%), influenza (13% vs. 4%), pharyngitis (8% vs. 3%), viral infection (7% vs. 1%), pyrexia (13% vs. 5%), cough (16% vs. 11%), and headache (25% vs. 16%) were increased over vehicle in the 1-year safety trial [see\u00a0adverse reactions (6.1)]. in 843 subjects ages 2-17 years treated with pimecrolimus cream, 1%, 9 (0.8%) developed eczema herpeticum (5 on pimecrolimus cream, 1% alone and 4 on pimecrolimus cream, 1% used in sequence with corticosteroids). in 211 subjects on vehicle alone, there were no cases of eczema herpeticum. the majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. two phase 3 trials were conducted involving 436 infants age 3 months-23 months. one 6-week randomized vehicle-controlled trial with a 20-week open-label phase and one safety trial, up to one year, were conducted. in the 6-week trial, 11% of pimecrolimus and 48% of vehicle subjects did not complete this trial; no subject in either group discontinued due to adverse events. infants on pimecrolimus cream, 1% had an increased incidence of some adverse events compared to vehicle. in the 6-week vehicle-controlled trial, these adverse events included pyrexia (32% vs. 13% vehicle), uri (24% vs. 14%), nasopharyngitis (15% vs. 8%), gastroenteritis (7% vs. 3%), otitis media (4% vs. 0%), and diarrhea (8% vs. 0%). in the open-label phase of the trial, for infants who switched to pimecrolimus cream, 1% from vehicle, the incidence of the above-cited adverse events approached or equaled the incidence of those subjects who remained on pimecrolimus cream, 1%. in the 6-month safety data, 16% of pimecrolimus and 35% of vehicle subjects discontinued early and 1.5% of pimecrolimus and 0% of vehicle subjects discontinued due to adverse events. infants on pimecrolimus cream, 1% had a greater incidence of some adverse events as compared to vehicle. these included pyrexia (30% vs. 20%), uri (21% vs. 17%), cough (15% vs. 9%), hypersensitivity (8% vs. 2%), teething (27% vs. 22%), vomiting (9% vs. 4%), rhinitis (13% vs. 9%), viral rash (4% vs. 0%), rhinorrhea (4% vs. 0%), and wheezing (4% vs. 0%). the systemic exposure to pimecrolimus from pimecrolimus cream, 1% was investigated in 28 pediatric subjects with atopic dermatitis (20%-80% bsa involvement) between the ages of 8 months-14 years. following twice daily application for 3 weeks, blood concentrations of pimecrolimus were <2 ng/ml with 60% (96/161) of the blood samples having blood concentration below the limit of quantification (0.5 ng/ml). however, more children (23 children out of the total 28 children investigated) had at least one detectable blood level as compared to the adults (12 adults out of the total 52 adults investigated) over a 3-week treatment period. due to the erratic nature of the blood levels observed, no correlation could be made between amount of cream, degree of bsa involvement, and blood concentrations. in general, the blood concentrations measured in adult atopic dermatitis subjects were comparable to those seen in the pediatric population. in a second group of 30 pediatric subjects aged 3-23 months with 10%-92% bsa involvement, following twice daily application for 3 weeks, blood concentrations of pimecrolimus were <2.6 ng/ml with 65% (75/116) of the blood samples having blood concentration below 0.5 ng/ml, and 27% (31/116) below the limit of quantification (0.1 ng/ml) for these trials. overall, a higher proportion of detectable blood levels was seen in the pediatric subject population as compared to adult population. this increase in the absolute number of positive blood levels may be due to the larger surface area to body mass ratio seen in these younger subjects. in addition, a higher incidence of upper respiratory symptoms/infections was also seen relative to the older age group in the pk trials. at this time, a causal relationship between these findings and pimecrolimus use cannot be ruled out.",

[see warnings and precautions (5.10) and animal toxicology and/or pharmacology (13.2)]. inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) levofloxacin is indicated in pediatric patients for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure). the risk-benefit assessment indicates that administration of levofloxacin to pediatric patients is appropriate. the safety of levofloxacin in pediatric patients treated for more than 14 days has not been studied. the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin following a single intravenous dose were investigated in pediatric patients ranging in age from six months to 16 years. pediatric patients cleared levofloxacin faster than adult patients resulting in lower plasma exposures than adults for a given mg/kg dose [see indications and usage (1.13), dosage and administration (2.2), clinical pharmacology (12.3) and clinical studies (14.9)]. adverse events in clinical trials, 1534 children (6 months to 16 years of age) were treated with oral and intravenous levaquin\u00ae. children 6 months to 5 years of age received levaquin\u00ae 10 mg/kg twice a day and children greater than 5 years of age received 10 mg/kg once a day (maximum 500 mg per day) for approximately 10 days. a subset of children in the clinical trials (1340 levaquin\u00ae-treated and 893 non-fluoroquinolone-treated) enrolled in a prospective, long-term surveillance study to assess the incidence of protocol-defined musculoskeletal disorders (arthralgia, arthritis, tendinopathy, gait abnormality) during 60 days and 1 year following the first dose of the study drug. children treated with levaquin\u00ae had a significantly higher incidence of musculoskeletal disorders when compared to the non-fluoroquinolone-treated children as illustrated in table 9. table 9: incidence of musculoskeletal disorders in pediatric clinical trial follow-up period levaquin\u00ae n = 1340 non-fluoroquinolonenon-fluoroquinolone: ceftriaxone, amoxicillin/ clavulanate, clarithromycin n = 893 p-value2-sided fisher's exact test 60 days 28 (2.1%) 8 (0.9%) p = 0.038 1 yearthere were 1199 levaquin\u00ae-treated and 804 non-fluoroquinolone-treated children who had a one-year evaluation visit. however, the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders was calculated using all reported events during the specified period for all children enrolled regardless of whether they completed the 1-year evaluation visit. 46 (3.4%) 16 (1.8%) p = 0.025 arthralgia was the most frequently occurring musculoskeletal disorder in both treatment groups. most of the musculoskeletal disorders in both groups involved multiple weight-bearing joints. disorders were moderate in 8/46 (17%) children and mild in 35/46 (76%) levaquin\u00ae-treated children and most were treated with analgesics. the median time to resolution was 7 days for levaquin\u00ae-treated children and 9 for non-fluoroquinolone-treated children (approximately 80% resolved within 2 months in both groups). no child had a severe or serious disorder and all musculoskeletal disorders resolved without sequelae. vomiting and diarrhea were the most frequently reported adverse events, occurring in similar frequency in the levaquin\u00ae-treated and non-fluoroquinolone-treated children. in addition to the events reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, events reported in adults during clinical trials or post-marketing experience [see adverse reactions (6)] may also be expected to occur in pediatric patients.",

        "section_text": "the effectiveness of busulfan in the treatment of cml has not been speci\ufb01cally studied in pediatric patients. an open-label, uncontrolled study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of busulfan in 24 pediatric patients receiving busulfan as part of a conditioning regimen administered prior to hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation for a variety of malignant hematologic (n=15) or non-malignant diseases (n=9). patients ranged in age from 5 months to 16 years (median 3 years). busulfan dosing was targeted to achieve an area under the plasma concentration curve (auc) of 900-1350 \u03bcm\u2022min with an initial dose of 0.8 mg per kg or 1.0 mg per kg (based on actual body weight (abw)) if the patient was greater than 4 or less than or equal to 4 years, respectively. the dose was adjusted based on plasma concentration after completion of dose 1. patients received busulfan doses every six hours as a two-hour infusion over four days for a total of 16 doses, followed by cyclophosphamide 50 mg per kg once daily for four days. after one rest day, hematopoietic progenitor cells were infused. all patients received phenytoin as seizure prophylaxis. the target auc (900-1350\u00b15% \u03bcm\u2022min) for busulfan was achieved at dose 1 in 71% (17/24) of patients. steady state pharmacokinetic testing was performed at dose 9 and 13. busulfan levels were within the target range for 21 of 23 evaluable patients. all 24 patients experienced neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (anc) less than 0.5\u00d7109/l) and thrombocytopenia (platelet transfusions or platelet count less than 20,000/mm3). seventy-nine percent (19/24) of patients experienced lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count less than 0.1\u00d7109). in 23 patients, the anc recovered to greater than 0.5\u00d7109/l (median time to recovery = bmt day +13; range = bmt day +9 to +22). one patient who died on day +20 had not recovered to an anc >0.5\u00d7109/l. four (17%) patients died during the study. two patients died within 28 days of transplant; one with pneumonia and capillary leak syndrome, and the other with pneumonia and veno-occlusive disease. two patients died prior to day 100; one due to progressive disease and one due to multiorgan failure. adverse reactions were reported in all 24 patients during the study period (bmt day -10 through bmt day +28) or post-study surveillance period (day +29 through +100). these included vomiting (100%), nausea (83%), stomatitis (79%), hvod (21%), graft-versus host disease (gvhd) (25%), and pneumonia (21%). based on the results of this 24-patient clinical trial, a suggested dosing regimen of busulfan in pediatric patients is shown in the following dosing nomogram: busulfan dosing nomogram patient's actual body weight (abw) busulfan dosage less than or equal to12 kg 1.1 (mg per kg) greater than 12 kg 0.8 (mg per kg) simulations based on a pediatric population pharmacokinetic model indicate that approximately 60% of pediatric patients will achieve a target busulfan exposure (auc) between 900 to 1350 \u03bcm\u2022min with the \ufb01rst dose of busulfan using this dosing nomogram. therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment following the \ufb01rst dose of busulfan is recommended. dose adjustment based on therapeutic drug monitoring instructions for measuring the auc of busulfan at dose 1 (see blood sample collection for auc determination ) and the formula for adjustment of subsequent doses to achieve the desired target auc (1125 \u00b5m\u2219min), are provided below. adjusted dose (mg) = actual dose (mg) x target auc (\u03bcm\u2022min)/actual auc (\u03bcm\u2022min) for example, if a patient received a dose of 11 mg busulfan and if the corresponding auc measured was 800 \u00b5m\u2219min, for a target auc of 1125 \u00b5m\u2219min, the target mg dose would be: mg dose =11 mg x 1125 \u03bcm\u2022min /800 \u03bcm\u2022min =15.5 mg busulfan dose adjustment may be made using this formula and instructions below. blood sample collection for auc determination calculate the auc (\u00b5m\u2219min) based on blood samples collected at the following time points: for dose 1: 2 hr (end of infusion), 4 hr and 6 hr (immediately prior to the next scheduled busulfan administration). actual sampling times should be recorded. for doses other than dose 1: pre-infusion (baseline), 2 hr (end of infusion), 4 hr and 6 hr (immediately prior to the next scheduled busulfan administration). auc calculations based on fewer than the three specified samples may result in inaccurate auc determinations. for each scheduled blood sample, collect one to three ml of blood into heparinized (na or li heparin) vacutainer\u00ae tubes. the blood samples should be placed on wet ice immediately after collection and should be centrifuged (at 4\u00b0c) within one hour. the plasma, harvested into appropriate cryovial storage tubes, is to be frozen immediately at -20\u00b0c. all plasma samples are to be sent in a frozen state (i.e., on dry ice) to the assay laboratory for the determination of plasma busulfan concentrations. calculation of auc busulfan auc calculations may be made using the following instructions and appropriate standard pharmacokinetic formula: dose 1 aucinfinity calculation: aucinfinity = auc0\u20136hr +aucextrapolated, where auc0\u20136hr is to be estimated using the linear trapezoidal rule and auc extrapolated can be computed by taking the ratio of the busulfan concentration at hour 6 and the terminal elimination rate constant, \u03bbz. the \u03bbz must be calculated from the terminal elimination phase of the busulfan concentration vs. time curve. a \"0\" pre-dose busulfan concentration should be assumed, and used in the calculation of auc. if the auc is assessed subsequent to dose 1, steady-state aucss (auc0\u20136hr) is to be estimated from the trough, 2 hr, 4 hr and 6 hr concentrations using the linear trapezoidal rule. instructions for drug administration and blood sample collection for therapeutic drug monitoring use an administration set with minimal residual hold up (priming) volume (1 to 3 ml) for drug infusion to ensure accurate delivery of the entire prescribed dose and to ensure accurate collection of blood samples for therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment. prime the administration set tubing with drug solution to allow accurate documentation of the start time of busulfan infusion. collect the blood sample from a peripheral iv line to avoid contamination with infusing drug. if the blood sample is taken directly from the existing central venous catheter (cvc), do not collect the blood sample while the drug is infusing to ensure that the end of infusion sample is not contaminated with any residual drug. at the end of infusion (2 hr), disconnect the administration tubing and \ufb02ush the cvc line with 5 ml of normal saline prior to the collection of the end of infusion sample from the cvc port. collect the blood samples from a different port than that used for the busulfan infusion. when recording the busulfan infusion stop time, do not include the time required to \ufb02ush the indwelling catheter line. discard the administration tubing at the end of the two-hour infusion\u00a0[see dosage and administration (2.3) ].",

than one year of age the pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole were studied in pediatric patients with gerd aged less than 28 days and one to 11 months. compared to healthy adults receiving 30 mg, neonates had higher exposure (mean weight-based normalized auc values 2.04- and 1.88-fold higher at doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day and 1 mg/kg/day, respectively). infants aged \u2264 10 weeks had clearance and

symptomatic gerd based on a medical history of crying/fussing/irritability associated with feedings who had not responded to conservative gerd management (i.e., nonpharmacologic intervention) for seven to 14 days. patients received lansoprazole as a suspension daily (0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg/day in infants \u2264 10 weeks of age or 1 to 1.5 mg/kg/day in infants greater than 10 weeks or placebo) for up to four weeks of double-blind treatment. the primary efficacy endpoint was assessed by greater than 50% reduction from baseline in either the percent of feedings with a crying/fussing/irritability episode or the duration (minutes) of a crying/fussing/irritability episode within one hour after feeding. there was no difference in the percentage of responders between the lansoprazole pediatric suspension group and placebo group (54% in both groups). there were no adverse events reported in pediatric clinical studies (one month to less than 12 months of age) that were not previously observed in adults. based on the results of the phase 3 efficacy study, lansoprazole was not shown to be effective. therefore, these results do not support the use of lansoprazole in treating symptomatic gerd in infants. one to 11 years of age in an uncontrolled, open-label, u.s. multicenter study, 66 pediatric patients (one to 11 years of age) with gerd were assigned, based on body weight, to receive an initial dose of either lansoprazole 15 mg daily if \u2264 30 kg or lansoprazole 30 mg daily if greater than 30 kg administered for eight to 12 weeks. the lansoprazole dose was increased (up to 30 mg

        "section_text": "clinical studies in pediatric patients included a placebo-controlled trial in pubertal boys of adolescent age with gynecomastia and a single-arm trial in girls with mccune-albright syndrome and progressive precocious puberty.  the efficacy of arimidex in the treatment of pubertal gynecomastia in adolescent boys and in the treatment of precocious puberty in girls with mccune-albright syndrome has not been demonstrated. gynecomastia study a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study enrolled 80 boys with pubertal gynecomastia aged 11 to 18 years.  patients were randomized to a daily regimen of either arimidex 1 mg or placebo.  after 6 months of treatment there was no statistically significant difference in the percentage of patients who experienced a \u226550% reduction in gynecomastia (primary efficacy analysis).  secondary efficacy analyses (absolute change in breast volume, the percentage of patients who had any reduction in the calculated volume of gynecomastia, breast pain resolution) were consistent with the primary efficacy analysis.  serum estradiol concentrations at month 6 of treatment were reduced by 15.4% in the arimidex group and  4.5% in the placebo group. adverse reactions that were assessed as treatment-related by the investigators occurred in 16.3% of the arimidex-treated patients and 8.1% of the placebo-treated patients with the most frequent being acne (7% arimidex and 2.7% placebo) and headache (7% arimidex and 0% placebo); all other adverse reactions showed small differences between treatment groups. one patient treated with arimidex discontinued the trial because of testicular enlargement.  the mean baseline-subtracted change  in testicular volume after 6 months of treatment was + 6.6 \u00b1 7.9 cm3 in the arimidex-treated patients and + 5.2 \u00b1 8.0 cm3 in the placebo group. mccune-albright syndrome study a multi-center, single-arm, open-label study was conducted in 28 girls with mccune-albright syndrome and progressive precocious puberty aged 2 to <10 years.  all patients received a 1 mg daily dose of arimidex.  the trial duration was 12 months. patients were enrolled on the basis of a diagnosis of typical (27/28) or atypical (1/27) mccune-albright syndrome, precocious puberty, history of vaginal bleeding, and/or advanced bone age.  patients\u2019 baseline characteristics included the following: a mean chronological age of 5.9 \u00b1 2.0 years, a mean bone age of 8.6 \u00b1 2.6 years, a mean growth rate of 7.9 \u00b1 2.9 cm/year and a mean tanner stage for breast of 2.7 \u00b1 0.81.  compared to pre-treatment data there were no on-treatment statistically significant reductions in the frequency of vaginal bleeding days, or in the rate of increase of bone age (defined as a ratio between the change in bone age over the change of chronological age).  there were no clinically significant changes in tanner staging, mean ovarian volume, mean uterine volume and mean predicted adult height.  a small but statistically significant reduction of growth rate from 7.9 \u00b1 2.9 cm/year to 6.5 \u00b1 2.8 cm/year was observed but the absence of a control group precludes attribution of this effect to treatment or to other confounding factors such as variations in endogenous estrogen levels commonly seen in mccune-albright syndrome patients. five patients (18%) experienced adverse reactions that were considered possibly related to arimidex. these were nausea, acne, pain in an extremity, increased alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, and allergic dermatitis. pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients following 1 mg once daily multiple administration in pediatric patients, the mean time to reach the maximum anastrozole concentration was 1 hr. the mean (range) disposition parameters of anastrozole in pediatric patients were described by a cl/f of 1.54 l/h (0.77-4.53 l/h) and v/f of 98.4 l (50.7-330.0 l). the terminal elimination half-life was 46.8 h, which was similar to that observed in postmenopausal women treated with anastrozole for breast cancer. based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the pharmacokinetics of anastrozole was similar in boys with pubertal gynecomastia and girls with mccune-albright syndrome.",
