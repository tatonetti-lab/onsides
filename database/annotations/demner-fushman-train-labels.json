        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n  EXCERPT:    For All Indications:  \n\n\n\n *  The potency Units of XEOMIN are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products. Therefore, Units of biological activity of XEOMIN cannot be compared to or converted into Units of any other botulinum toxin products (  5.2  ). \n *  Immediate medical attention may be required in cases of respiratory, speech or swallowing difficulties (  5.1  ,  5.4  ). \n *  Use with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function or dysphagia (  5.4  ). \n *  Concomitant neuromuscular disorders may exacerbate clinical effects of treatment (  5.5  ). \n     Cervical Dystonia (  5.4  ):  \n \n\n *  Patients with smaller neck muscle mass and patients who require bilateral injections into the sternocleidomastoid muscles are at greater risk of dysphagia. \n *  Limiting the dose injected into the sternocleidomastoid muscle may decrease the occurrence of dysphagia. \n     Blepharospasm (  5.6  ):  \n \n\n *  Corneal exposure and ulceration \n *  Injection of XEOMIN into the orbicularis oculi muscle may lead to reduced blinking and corneal exposure with possible ulceration or perforation. \n *  Lower lid injections should not be repeated if diplopia occurred with previous botulinum toxin injections. \n     Glabellar Lines (  5.7  ):  \n \n\n *  Risk of ptosis (  5.7  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Spread of Toxin Effect\n\n\n\n  Postmarketing safety data from XEOMIN and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death related to the spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, and particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses, including spasticity in children and adults, and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than doses used to treat cervical dystonia.\n\n\n\n Patients or caregivers should be advised to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech, or respiratory disorders occur.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Lack of Interchangeability between Botulinum Toxin Products\n\n\n\n  The potency Units of XEOMIN are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with the other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, Units of biological activity of XEOMIN cannot be compared to or converted into Units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see  Description (11)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with botulinum toxin products (anaphylaxis, serum sickness, urticaria, soft tissue edema, and dyspnea). If serious and/or immediate hypersensitivity reactions occur further injection of XEOMIN should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy immediately instituted.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Dysphagia and Breathing Difficulties in Treatment of Cervical Dystonia\n\n\n\n  Treatment with XEOMIN and other botulinum toxin products can result in swallowing or breathing difficulties. Patients with pre-existing swallowing or breathing difficulties may be more susceptible to these complications. In most cases, this is a consequence of weakening of muscles in the area of injection that are involved in breathing or swallowing. When distant effects occur, additional respiratory muscles may be involved [See  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Deaths as a complication of severe dysphagia have been reported after treatment with botulinum toxin. Dysphagia may persist for several months, and require use of a feeding tube to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration. Aspiration may result from severe dysphagia and is a particular risk when treating patients in whom swallowing or respiratory function is already compromised.\n\n\n\n Treatment of cervical dystonia with botulinum toxins may weaken neck muscles that serve as accessory muscles of ventilation. This may result in critical loss of breathing capacity in patients with respiratory disorders who may have become dependent upon these accessory muscles. There have been post-marketing reports of serious breathing difficulties, including respiratory failure, in patients with cervical dystonia treated with botulinum toxin products.\n\n\n\n Patients with smaller neck muscle mass and patients who require bilateral injections into the sternocleidomastoid muscles have been reported to be at greater risk of dysphagia. In general, limiting the dose injected into the sternocleidomastoid muscle may decrease the occurrence of dysphagia.\n\n\n\n Patients treated with botulinum toxin may require immediate medical attention should they develop problems with swallowing, speech or respiratory disorders. These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after injection with botulinum toxin [See  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Pre-existing Neuromuscular Disorders and other Special Populations\n\n\n\n  Individuals with peripheral motor neuropathic diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or neuromuscular junctional disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome) should be monitored particularly closely when given botulinum toxin. Patients with neuromuscular disorders may be at increased risk of clinically significant effects including severe dysphagia and respiratory compromise from typical doses of XEOMIN [See  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.6 Corneal Exposure, Corneal Ulceration, and Ectropion in Patients Treated with XEOMIN for Blepharospasm\n\n\n\n  Reduced blinking from injection of botulinum toxin products in the orbicularis muscle can lead to corneal exposure, persistent epithelial defect and corneal ulceration, especially in patients with VII nerve disorders. Careful testing of corneal sensation in eyes previously operated upon, avoidance of injection into the lower lid area to avoid ectropion, and vigorous treatment of any epithelial defect should be employed. This may require protective drops, ointment, therapeutic soft contact lenses, or closure of the eye by patching or other means. Because of its anticholinergic effects, XEOMIN should be used with caution in patients at risk of developing narrow angle glaucoma. To prevent ectropion, botulinum toxin products should not be injected into the medial lower eyelid area.\n\n\n\n Ecchymosis easily occurs in the soft tissues of the eyelid. Immediate gentle pressure at the injection site can limit that risk.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Risk of Ptosis in Patients Treated with XEOMIN for Glabellar Lines\n\n\n\n  Do not exceed the recommended dosage and frequency of administration of XEOMIN.\n\n\n\n In order to reduce the complication of ptosis the following steps should be taken:\n\n\n\n *  Avoid injection near the levator palpebrae superioris, particularly in patients with larger brow depressor complexes. \n *  Corrugator injections should be placed at least 1 cm above the bony supraorbital ridge. \n       5.8 Human Albumin and Transmission of Viral Diseases\n \n\n  This product contains albumin, a derivative of human blood. Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases. A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is also considered extremely remote. No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been reported for albumin.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Do not use near eyes or mucous membranes. (  5.1  ) \n *  Inhalation of airborne capsaicin can result in coughing or sneezing. (  5.2  ) \n *  If irritation of eyes or airway occurs, remove the affected individual from the vicinity of Qutenza and flush the mucous membranes or eyes with water. If skin not intended to be treated comes into contact with Qutenza, apply Cleansing Gel and then wipe off with dry gauze. (  5.2  ,  5.3  ) \n *  Transient increases in blood pressure may occur in patients during and shortly after the Qutenza treatment. Monitor blood pressure during and following the treatment procedure. For those patients who require the use of opioids to treat pain during or following the procedure, their ability to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving or operating machinery may be affected. (  5.4  ,  5.5  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Eye and Mucous Membrane Exposure\n\n\n\n  Do not apply Qutenza to the face or scalp to avoid risk of exposure to the eyes or mucous membranes.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Aerosolization of Capsaicin\n\n\n\n  Aerosolization of capsaicin can occur upon rapid removal of Qutenza patches. Therefore, remove Qutenza patches gently and slowly by rolling the adhesive side inward [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3  )]  .\n\n\n\n If irritation of eyes or airways occurs, remove the affected individual from the vicinity of Qutenza. Flush eyes and mucous membranes with cool water.\n\n\n\n Inhalation of airborne capsaicin can result in coughing or sneezing. Provide supportive medical care if shortness of breath develops.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Unintended Skin Exposure\n\n\n\n  If skin not intended to be treated comes in contact with Qutenza, apply Cleansing Gel for one minute and wipe off with dry gauze. After the Cleansing Gel has been wiped off, wash the area with soap and water.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Application Associated Pain\n\n\n\n  Even following use of a local anesthetic prior to administration of Qutenza, patients may experience substantial procedural pain. Prepare to treat acute pain during and following the application procedure with local cooling (such as an ice pack) and/or appropriate analgesic medication, such as opioids. Opioids may affect the ability to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving or operating machinery.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Increase in Blood Pressure\n\n\n\n  In clinical trials, increases in blood pressure occurred during or shortly after exposure to Qutenza. The changes averaged less than 10 mm Hg, although some patients had greater increases and these changes lasted for approximately two hours after patch removal. Increases in blood pressure were unrelated to the pretreatment blood pressure but were related to treatment-related increases in pain. Monitor blood pressure periodically during the treatment and provide adequate support for treatment related pain.\n\n\n\n Patients with unstable or poorly controlled hypertension, a recent history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events may be at an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular effects. Consider these factors prior to initiating Qutenza treatment.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Mineralocorticoid excess: Use ZYTIGA with caution in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. The safety of ZYTIGA in patients with LVEF < 50% or NYHA Class III or IV heart failure in Study 1 or LVEF < 50% or NYHA Class II to IV heart failure in Study 2 was not established. Control hypertension and correct hypokalemia before treatment. Monitor blood pressure, serum potassium and symptoms of fluid retention at least monthly. (5.1) \n *  Adrenocortical insufficiency: Monitor for symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency. Increased dosage of corticosteroids may be indicated before, during and after stressful situations. (5.2) \n *  Hepatotoxicity: Increases in liver enzymes have led to drug interruption, dose modification and/or discontinuation. Monitor liver function and modify, interrupt, or discontinue ZYTIGA dosing as recommended. (5.3) \n    \n   5.1 Hypertension, Hypokalemia and Fluid Retention Due to Mineralocorticoid Excess\n\n  ZYTIGA may cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention as a consequence of increased mineralocorticoid levels resulting from CYP17 inhibition  [seeClinical Pharmacology (12.1)]  . In the two randomized clinical trials, grade 3 to 4 hypertension occurred in 2% of patients, grade 3 to 4 hypokalemia in 4% of patients, and grade 3 to 4 edema in 1% of patients treated with ZYTIGA  [seeAdverse Reactions (6)]  .\n\n\n\n Co-administration of a corticosteroid suppresses adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) drive, resulting in a reduction in the incidence and severity of these adverse reactions. Use caution when treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure, hypokalemia or fluid retention, e.g., those with heart failure, recent myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia. Use ZYTIGA with caution in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. The safety of ZYTIGA in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <50% or New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure (in Study 1) or NYHA Class II to IV heart failure (in Study 2) was not established because these patients were excluded from these randomized clinical trials  [seeClinical Studies (14)]  . Monitor patients for hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention at least once a month. Control hypertension and correct hypokalemia before and during treatment with ZYTIGA.\n\n\n\n   5.2 Adrenocortical Insufficiency\n\n  Adrenal insufficiency occurred in the two randomized clinical studies in 0.5% of patients taking ZYTIGA and in 0.2% of patients taking placebo. Adrenocortical insufficiency was reported in patients receiving ZYTIGA in combination with prednisone, following interruption of daily steroids and/or with concurrent infection or stress. Use caution and monitor for symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency, particularly if patients are withdrawn from prednisone, have prednisone dose reductions, or experience unusual stress. Symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency may be masked by adverse reactions associated with mineralocorticoid excess seen in patients treated with ZYTIGA. If clinically indicated, perform appropriate tests to confirm the diagnosis of adrenocortical insufficiency. Increased dosage of corticosteroids may be indicated before, during and after stressful situations  [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)].  \n\n\n\n   5.3 Hepatotoxicity\n\n  In the two randomized clinical trials, grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5* ULN) were reported in 4% of patients who received ZYTIGA, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to liver enzyme increases occurred in 1% of patients taking ZYTIGA. No deaths clearly related to ZYTIGA were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.\n\n\n\n Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with ZYTIGA, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced ZYTIGA dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient's baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt ZYTIGA treatment and closely monitor liver function.\n\n\n\n Re-treatment with ZYTIGA at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5* ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5* ULN  [seeDosage and Administration (2.2)].  \n\n\n\n The safety of ZYTIGA re-treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20* ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10* ULN is unknown.\n",

(  5.1  ). \n *    Toviaz should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. (  5.2  ) \n *    Toviaz, like other antimuscarinic drugs, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, such as those with severe constipation. (  5.3  ) \n *    Toviaz should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma, and only where the potential benefits outweigh the risks (  5.4  ) \n *    Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with Toviaz. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Toviaz affects them (  5.5  ) \n *    Toviaz should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. (  5.9  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Angioedema\n\n\n\n  Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with fesoterodine. In some cases angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, fesoterodine should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Bladder Outlet Obstruction\n\n\n\n  Toviaz should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [ see  Contraindications (4)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.3 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility\n\n\n\n  Toviaz, like other antimuscarinic drugs, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, such as those with severe constipation.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma\n\n\n\n  Toviaz should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma, and only where the potential benefits outweigh the risks [ see  Contraindications (4)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.5 Central Nervous System Effects\n\n\n\n  Toviaz is associated with anticholinergic central nervous sytem (CNS) effects [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including headache, dizziness, and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Toviaz affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Hepatic Impairment\n\n\n\n  Toviaz has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and therefore is not recommended for use in this patient population [ see  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  and  Dosage and Administration (2)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.7 Renal Impairment\n\n\n\n  Doses of Toviaz greater than 4 mg are not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment [ see  Use In Specific Populations (8.6)  and  Dosage and Administration (2)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.8 Concomitant Administration with CYP3A4 Inhibitors\n\n\n\n    *     Doses of Toviaz greater than 4 mg are not recommended in patients taking a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin). \n *     No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil and grapefruit juice). \n *     While the effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined by clinical study, some pharmacokinetic interaction is expected, albeit less than that observed with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors [ see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  and  Dosage and Administration (2)   ]. \n       5.9 Myasthenia Gravis\n \n\n  Toviaz should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  New onset or worsening renal impairment: Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome. Assess creatinine clearance (CLcr), urine glucose and urine protein before initiating treatment with STRIBILD. Monitor CLcr, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. Monitor serum phosphorus in patients at risk for renal impairment. Avoid administering STRIBILD with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs. (  5.3  ) \n *  Avoid coadministration with other anti-retroviral products: Do not use with products containing any of the components of STRIBILD (cobicistat, elvitegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), including ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, TRUVADA, TYBOST, VIREAD, or VITEKTA; with drugs containing lamivudine; or with drugs or regimens containing ritonavir. Do not administer in combination with HEPSERA. (  5.4  ) \n *  Risk of adverse reactions or loss of virologic response due to drug interactions: The concomitant use of STRIBILD and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of STRIBILD and possible development of resistance; and possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs. (  5.5  ) \n *  Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD): Consider monitoring BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors of osteoporosis or bone loss. (  5.6  ) \n *  Redistribution/accumulation of body fat: Observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. (  5.7  ) \n *  Immune reconstitution syndrome: May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. (  5.8  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis\n\n\n\n  Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including tenofovir DF, a component of STRIBILD, in combination with other antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogs to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Treatment with STRIBILD should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).\n\n\n\n    5.2 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV\n\n\n\n  It is recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating antiretroviral therapy. STRIBILD is not approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and the safety and efficacy of STRIBILD have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued emtricitabine or tenofovir DF, two of the components of STRIBILD. In some patients infected with HBV and treated with EMTRIVA, the exacerbations of hepatitis B were associated with liver decompensation and liver failure. Patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment with STRIBILD. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.\n\n\n\n    5.3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment\n\n\n\n  Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir DF, a component of STRIBILD, and with the use of STRIBILD [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n  In the clinical trials of STRIBILD over 144 weeks, 13 (1.9%) subjects in the STRIBILD group (N=701), 8 (2.3%) subjects in the ATV + RTV + TRUVADA group (N=355) and no subjects in the ATRIPLA group (N = 352) discontinued study drug due to a renal adverse reaction. Of these discontinuations, 8 in the STRIBILD group and 1 in the ATV + RTV + TRUVADA group occurred during the first 48 weeks. Four (0.6%) subjects who received STRIBILD developed laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubular dysfunction leading to discontinuation of STRIBILD during the first 48 weeks of treatment. Two of the four subjects had renal impairment (i.e. estimated creatinine clearance less than 70 mL per minute) at baseline. The laboratory findings in these 4 subjects improved but did not completely resolve in all subjects upon discontinuation of STRIBILD. Renal replacement therapy was not required for these subjects. One (0.3%) subject who received ATV + RTV + TRUVADA developed laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubular dysfunction leading to discontinuation of ATV + RTV + TRUVADA after Week 96.  \n\n\n\n STRIBILD should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent. (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) [see  Drug Interactions (7.4)  ]  . Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir DF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.\n\n\n\n Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in at-risk patients.\n\n\n\n Estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose and urine protein should be documented in all patients prior to initiating therapy. Initiation of STRIBILD in patients with estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL per minute is not recommended.\n\n\n\n Routine monitoring of estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein should be performed during STRIBILD therapy in all patients. Additionally, serum phosphorus should be measured in patients at risk for renal impairment. Although cobicistat (a component of STRIBILD) may cause modest increases in serum creatinine and modest declines in estimated creatinine clearance without affecting renal glomerular function [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  , patients who experience a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than 0.4 mg per dL from baseline should be closely monitored for renal safety.\n\n\n\n The emtricitabine and tenofovir DF components of STRIBILD are primarily excreted by the kidney. STRIBILD should be discontinued if estimated creatinine clearance declines below 50 mL per minute as dose interval adjustment required for emtricitabine and tenofovir DF cannot be achieved with the fixed-dose combination tablet.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Avoid Use with Other Antiretroviral Products\n\n\n\n  STRIBILD is indicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and coadministration with other antiretroviral products is not recommended.\n\n\n\n STRIBILD is not recommended for coadministration with the following:\n\n\n\n *   cobicistat (TYBOST);  \n *   elvitegravir (VITEKTA);  \n *   products containing emtricitabine or tenofovir DF (ATRIPLA, COMPLERA, EMTRIVA, TRUVADA, VIREAD);  \n *   products containing lamivudine (COMBIVIR, EPIVIR, EPIVIR-HBV, EPZICOM, TRIUMEQ, TRIZIVIR);  \n *   adefovir dipivoxil (HEPSERA);  \n *   products containing ritonavir (NORVIR, KALETRA)  \n       5.5 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions\n \n\n   The concomitant use of STRIBILD and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see  Contraindications (4)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.5)  ]:    \n\n\n\n *   Loss of therapeutic effect of STRIBILD and possible development of resistance.  \n *   Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs.  \n     See  Table 6  for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see  Drug Interactions (7.5)  ]  . Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during STRIBILD therapy; review concomitant medications during STRIBILD therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs.  \n \n\n    5.6 Bone Effects of Tenofovir DF\n\n\n\n   Bone Mineral Density:  \n\n\n\n In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults, tenofovir DF (a component of STRIBILD) was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1.25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir DF. For additional information, see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and consult the VIREAD prescribing information.\n\n\n\n The effects of tenofovir DF-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for HIV-1 infected patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial in all patients. If bone abnormalities are suspected, then appropriate consultation should be obtained.\n\n\n\n    Mineralization Defects:  \n\n\n\n Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of tenofovir DF [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  . Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing tenofovir DF [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.7 Fat Redistribution\n\n\n\n  Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including STRIBILD. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia (PCP), or tuberculosis], which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.\n\n\n\n Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *     Hypotension: Before initiating FARXIGA, assess volume status and correct hypovolemia in the elderly, in patients with renal impairment or low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy.  (5.1  ,  6.1)   \n *     Impairment in renal function: Monitor renal function during therapy.  (5.2)   \n *     Hypoglycemia: In patients taking insulin or an insulin secretagogue with FARXIGA, consider a lower dose of insulin or the insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.  (5.3)   \n *     Genital mycotic infections: Monitor and treat if indicated.  (5.4)   \n *     Increased LDL-C: Monitor and treat per standard of care.  (5.5)   \n *     Bladder Cancer: An imbalance in bladder cancers was observed in clinical trials. FARXIGA should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and should be used with caution in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer.  (5.6)   \n *     Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with FARXIGA or any other antidiabetic drug.  (5.7)   \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hypotension\n\n\n\n  FARXIGA causes intravascular volume contraction. Symptomatic hypotension can occur after initiating FARXIGA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  particularly in patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics. Before initiating FARXIGA in patients with one or more of these characteristics, volume status should be assessed and corrected. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Impairment in Renal Function\n\n\n\n  FARXIGA increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function may be more susceptible to these changes. Adverse reactions related to renal function can occur after initiating FARXIGA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiation of FARXIGA and monitored periodically thereafter.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\n\n\n  Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. FARXIGA can increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when these agents are used in combination with FARXIGA.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Genital Mycotic Infections\n\n\n\n  FARXIGA increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor and treat appropriately.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)\n\n\n\n  Increases in LDL-C occur with FARXIGA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor LDL-C and treat per standard of care after initiating FARXIGA.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Bladder Cancer\n\n\n\n  Across 22 clinical studies, newly diagnosed cases of bladder cancer were reported in 10/6045 patients (0.17%) treated with FARXIGA and 1/3512 patient (0.03%) treated with placebo/comparator. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 4 cases with FARXIGA and no cases with placebo/comparator. Bladder cancer risk factors and hematuria (a potential indicator of pre-existing tumors) were balanced between treatment arms at baseline. There were too few cases to determine whether the emergence of these events is related to FARXIGA.\n\n\n\n There are insufficient data to determine whether FARXIGA has an effect on pre-existing bladder tumors. Consequently, FARXIGA should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer. In patients with prior history of bladder cancer, the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with FARXIGA should be considered.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\n\n\n  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with FARXIGA or any other antidiabetic drug.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n  EXCERPT:    Use of VICTRELIS with Ribavirin and Peginterferon alfa:  \n\n\n\n *   Embryofetal Toxicity (Use with Ribavirin and Peginterferon Alfa): Ribavirin may cause birth defects and fetal death; avoid pregnancy in female patients and female partners of male patients. Patients must have a negative pregnancy test prior to therapy; use two or more forms of contraception, and have monthly pregnancy tests. (  5.1  ) \n *  Anemia - The addition of VICTRELIS to peginterferon alfa and ribavirin is associated with an additional decrease in hemoglobin concentrations compared with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin alone. (  5.2  ) \n *  Neutropenia - The addition of VICTRELIS to peginterferon alfa and ribavirin may result in worsening of neutropenia associated with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin therapy alone. (  5.3  ) \n *  Hypersensitivity - Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) have been observed during combination therapy with VICTRELIS, peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. (  5.5  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity (Use with Ribavirin and Peginterferon Alfa)\n\n\n\n  Ribavirin may cause birth defects and/or death of the exposed fetus. Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and in female partners of male patients. Ribavirin therapy should not be started unless a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to initiation of therapy. Refer to the prescribing information for ribavirin for additional information.\n\n\n\n Women of childbearing potential and men must use at least two forms of effective contraception during treatment and for at least 6 months after treatment has concluded. One of these forms of contraception can be a combined oral contraceptive product containing at least 1 mg of norethindrone. Oral contraceptives containing lower doses of norethindrone and other forms of hormonal contraception have not been studied or are contraindicated. Routine monthly pregnancy tests must be performed during this time [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Drug Interactions (7)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Anemia (Use with Ribavirin and Peginterferon Alfa)\n\n\n\n  Anemia has been reported with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin therapy. The addition of VICTRELIS to peginterferon alfa and ribavirin is associated with an additional decrease in hemoglobin concentrations. Complete blood counts (with white blood cell differential counts) should be obtained pretreatment, and at Treatment Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, and should be monitored closely at other time points, as clinically appropriate. If hemoglobin is less than 10 g per dL, a decrease in dosage of ribavirin is recommended; and if hemoglobin is less than 8.5 g per dL, discontinuation of ribavirin is recommended [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  and  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . If ribavirin is permanently discontinued for management of anemia, then peginterferon alfa and VICTRELIS must also be discontinued [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Refer to the prescribing information for ribavirin for additional information regarding dose reduction and/or discontinuation.\n\n\n\n In clinical trials with VICTRELIS, the proportion of subjects who experienced hemoglobin values less than 10 g per dL and less than 8.5 g per dL was higher in subjects treated with the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron  (r)  /REBETOL  (r)  than in those treated with PegIntron/REBETOL alone (see  Table 4  ). With the interventions used for anemia management in the clinical trials, the average additional decrease of hemoglobin was approximately 1 g per dL.\n\n\n\n In clinical trials, the median time to onset of hemoglobin less than 10 g per dL from the initiation of therapy was similar among subjects treated with the combination of VICTRELIS and PegIntron/REBETOL (71 days with a range of 15-337 days), compared to those who received PegIntron/REBETOL (71 days with a range of 8-337 days). Certain adverse reactions consistent with symptoms of anemia, such as dyspnea, exertional dyspnea, dizziness and syncope were reported more frequently in subjects who received the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL than in those treated with PegIntron/REBETOL alone [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n In clinical trials with VICTRELIS, dose modifications (generally of PegIntron/REBETOL) due to anemia occurred twice as often in subjects treated with the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL (26%) compared to PegIntron/REBETOL (13%). The proportion of subjects who discontinued study drug due to anemia was 1% in subjects treated with the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL and 1% in subjects who received PegIntron/REBETOL. The use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) was permitted for management of anemia, at the investigator's discretion, with or without ribavirin dose reduction in the Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. The proportion of subjects who received an ESA was 43% in those treated with the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL compared to 24% in those treated with PegIntron/REBETOL alone. The proportion of subjects who received a transfusion for the management of anemia was 3% of subjects treated with the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL compared to less than 1% in subjects who received PegIntron/REBETOL alone.\n\n\n\n Thromboembolic events have been associated with ESA use in other disease states; and have also been reported with peginterferon alfa use in hepatitis C patients. Thromboembolic events were reported in clinical trials with VICTRELIS among subjects receiving the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL, and among those receiving PegIntron/REBETOL alone, regardless of ESA use. No definite causality assessment or benefit risk assessment could be made for these events due to the presence of confounding factors and lack of randomization of ESA use.\n\n\n\n A randomized, parallel-arm, open-label clinical trial was conducted in previously untreated CHC subjects with genotype 1 infection to compare use of an ESA versus ribavirin dose reduction for initial management of anemia during therapy with VICTRELIS in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. Similar SVR rates were reported in subjects who were randomized to receive ribavirin dose reduction compared to subjects who were randomized to receive an ESA. In this trial, use of ESAs was associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and deep vein thrombosis compared to ribavirin dose reduction alone. The treatment discontinuation rate due to anemia was similar in subjects randomized to receive ribavirin dose reduction compared to subjects randomized to receive ESA (2% in each group). The transfusion rate was 4% in subjects randomized to receive ribavirin dose reduction and 2% in subjects randomized to receive ESA.\n\n\n\n Ribavirin dose reduction is recommended for the initial management of anemia.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Neutropenia (Use with Ribavirin and Peginterferon Alfa)\n\n\n\n  In Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, seven percent of subjects receiving the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL had neutrophil counts of less than 0.5 * 10  9  per L compared to 4% of subjects receiving PegIntron/REBETOL alone (see  Table 4  ). Three subjects experienced severe or life-threatening infections associated with neutropenia, and two subjects experienced life-threatening neutropenia while receiving the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL. Complete blood counts (with white blood cell differential counts) should be obtained at pretreatment, and at Treatment Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, and should be monitored closely at other time points, as clinically appropriate. Decreases in neutrophil counts may require dose reduction or discontinuation of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. If peginterferon alfa and ribavirin are permanently discontinued, then VICTRELIS must also be discontinued [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  \n\n\n\n Refer to the prescribing information for peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for additional information regarding dose reduction or discontinuation.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Pancytopenia (Use with Ribavirin and Peginterferon Alfa)\n\n\n\n   Serious cases of pancytopenia have been reported postmarketing in patients receiving VICTRELIS in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. Complete blood counts (with white blood cell differential counts) should be obtained at pretreatment, and at Treatment Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, and should be monitored closely at other time points, as clinically appropriate.  \n\n\n\n  Refer to the prescribing information for ribavirin and peginterferon alfa for guidelines for discontinuation of therapy based on laboratory parameters.  \n\n\n\n    5.5 Hypersensitivity\n\n\n\n  Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema) have been observed during combination therapy with VICTRELIS, peginterferon alfa and ribavirin. If such an acute reaction occurs, combination therapy should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy immediately instituted [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.6 Drug Interactions\n\n\n\n  See  Table 2  for a listing of drugs that are contraindicated for use with VICTRELIS due to potentially life-threatening adverse events, significant drug interactions or loss of virologic activity [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  Please refer to  Table 5  for established and other potentially significant drug interactions [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.7 Laboratory Tests\n\n\n\n  HCV-RNA levels should be monitored at Treatment Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24, at the end of treatment, during treatment follow-up, and for other time points as clinically indicated. Use of a sensitive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for monitoring HCV-RNA levels during treatment is recommended. The assay should have a lower limit of HCV-RNA quantification of equal to or less than 25 IU per mL, and a limit of HCV-RNA detection of approximately 10 to 15 IU per mL. For the purposes of assessing Response-Guided Therapy milestones, a confirmed \"detectable but below limit of quantification\" HCV-RNA result should not be considered equivalent to an \"undetectable\" HCV-RNA result (reported as \"Target Not Detected\" or \"HCV-RNA Not Detected\").\n\n\n\n Complete blood count (with white blood cell differential counts) should be obtained at pretreatment, and at Treatment Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, and should be monitored closely at other time points, as clinically appropriate.\n\n\n\n  Refer to the prescribing information for peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for pre-treatment, on-treatment and post-treatment laboratory testing recommendations including hematology, biochemistry (including hepatic function tests), and pregnancy testing requirements.  \n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n  EXCERPT:   . Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Life-threatening anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in some patients during treatment with Vimizim. If anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reactions occur, immediately stop the infusion and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Pre-treatment with antihistamines with or without antipyretics is recommended prior to the start of infusion (  5.1  ). \n\n\n\n . Risk of Acute Respiratory Complications: Patients with acute febrile or respiratory illness may be at higher risk of life-threatening complications from hypersensitivity reactions. Careful consideration should be given to the patient's clinical status prior to administration of Vimizim and consider delaying the Vimizim infusion (  5.2  ).\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n   5.1 Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients treated with Vimizim. In premarketing clinical trials, 18 of 235 (7.7%) patients treated with Vimizim experienced signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis. These 18 patients experienced 26 anaphylactic reactions during infusion with signs and symptoms including cough, erythema, throat tightness, urticaria, flushing, cyanosis, hypotension, rash, dyspnea, chest discomfort, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, abdominal pain, retching, and vomiting) in conjunction with urticaria. These cases of anaphylaxis occurred as early as 30 minutes from the start of infusion and up to three hours after infusion.  Anaphylaxis occurred as late into treatment as the 47  th  infusion.\n\n\n\n In clinical trials with Vimizim, 44 of 235 (18.7%) patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred as early as 30 minutes from the start of infusion but as late as six days after infusion. Frequent symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions (occurring in more than 2 patients) included anaphylactic reactions, urticaria, peripheral edema, cough, dyspnea, and flushing.\n\n\n\n Due to the potential for anaphylaxis, appropriate medical support should be readily available when Vimizim is administered. Observe patients closely for an appropriate period of time after administration of Vimizim, taking into account the time to onset of anaphylaxis seen in premarketing clinical trials. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur. \n\n\n\n Because of the potential for hypersensitivity reactions, administer antihistamines with or without antipyretics prior to infusion. Management of hypersensitivity reactions should be based on the severity of the reaction and include slowing or temporary interruption of the infusion and/or administration of additional antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids for mild reactions. However, if severe hypersensitivity reactions occur, immediately stop the infusion of Vimizim and initiate appropriate treatment.\n\n\n\n Consider the risks and benefits of re-administering Vimizim following a severe reaction.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Risk of Acute Respiratory Complications\n\n\n\n  Patients with acute febrile or respiratory illness at the time of Vimizim infusion may be at higher risk of life-threatening complications from hypersensitivity reactions. Careful consideration should be given to the patient's clinical status prior to administration of Vimizim and consider delaying the Vimizim infusion.\n\n\n\n Sleep apnea is common in MPS IVA patients.  Evaluation of airway patency should be considered prior to initiation of treatment with Vimizim.  Patients using supplemental oxygen or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep should have these treatments readily available during infusion in the event of an acute reaction, or extreme drowsiness/sleep induced by antihistamine use.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Spinal or Cervical Cord Compression\n\n\n\n  Spinal or cervical cord compression (SCC) is a known and serious complication of MPS IVA and may occur as part of the natural history of the disease. In clinical trials, SCC was observed both in patients receiving Vimizim and patients receiving placebo.  Patients with MPS IVA should be monitored for signs and symptoms of SCC (including back pain, paralysis of limbs below the level of compression, urinary and fecal incontinence) and given appropriate clinical care.\n",

If such symptoms occur, discontinue PRISTIQ and initiate supportive treatment. If concomitant use of PRISTIQ with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (  5.2  ). \n *     Elevated Blood Pressure: Control hypertension before initiating treatment. Monitor blood pressure regularly during treatment (  5.3  ). \n *     Abnormal Bleeding: PRISTIQ may increase risk of bleeding events. Caution patients about risk of bleeding associated with concomitant use of PRISTIQ and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation (  5.4  ). \n *     Angle Closure Glaucoma: Angle closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants.

Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled studies of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.\n\n\n\n The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled studies in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term studies of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled studies in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term studies (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.\n\n\n\n Table 1 \n  Age Range           Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1,000 Patients Treated     \n  \n                      Increases Compared to Placebo                                          \n  <18                 14 additional cases                                                    \n  18 to 24            5 additional cases                                                     \n                      Decreases Compared to Placebo                                          \n  25 to 64            1 fewer case                                                           \n  >=65                6 fewer cases                                                          \n        No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric studies. There were suicides in the adult studies, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\n \n\n It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance studies in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.\n\n\n\n  All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.  \n\n\n\n The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.\n\n\n\n Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.\n\n\n\n If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  and  Warnings and Precautions (5.7)  for a description of the risks of discontinuation of PRISTIQ]  .\n\n\n\n  Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers  .\n\n\n\n Prescriptions for PRISTIQ should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.\n\n\n\n    Screening patients for bipolar disorder  \n\n\n\n A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled studies) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that PRISTIQ is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Serotonin Syndrome\n\n\n\n  The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including PRISTIQ, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort), and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).\n\n\n\n Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.\n\n\n\n The concomitant use of PRISTIQ with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. PRISTIQ should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with a MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking PRISTIQ. PRISTIQ should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (4.2)  and   Dosage and Administration (2.6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n If concomitant use of PRISTIQ with other serotonergic drugs, including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.\n\n\n\n Treatment with PRISTIQ and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Elevated Blood Pressure\n\n\n\n  Patients receiving PRISTIQ should have regular monitoring of blood pressure since increases in blood pressure were observed in clinical studies [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Pre-existing hypertension should be controlled before initiating treatment with PRISTIQ. Caution should be exercised in treating patients with pre-existing hypertension, cardiovascular, or cerebrovascular conditions that might be compromised by increases in blood pressure. Cases of elevated blood pressure requiring immediate treatment have been reported with PRISTIQ.\n\n\n\n Sustained blood pressure increases could have adverse consequences. For patients who experience a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving PRISTIQ, either dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4 Abnormal Bleeding\n\n\n\n  SSRIs and SNRIs, including PRISTIQ, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of PRISTIQ and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation or bleeding.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Angle Closure Glaucoma\n\n\n\n   Angle-Closure Glaucoma: The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including Pristiq may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.  \n\n\n\n    5.6 Activation of Mania/Hypomania\n\n\n\n  During all MDD phase 2 and phase 3 studies, mania was reported for approximately 0.02% of patients treated with PRISTIQ. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder who were treated with other marketed antidepressants. As with all antidepressants, PRISTIQ should be used cautiously in patients with a history or family history of mania or hypomania.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Discontinuation Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Discontinuation symptoms have been systematically and prospectively evaluated in patients treated with PRISTIQ during clinical studies in Major Depressive Disorder. Abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction has been associated with the appearance of new symptoms that include dizziness, nausea, headache, irritability, insomnia, diarrhea, anxiety, fatigue, abnormal dreams, and hyperhidrosis. In general, discontinuation events occurred more frequently with longer duration of therapy.\n\n\n\n During marketing of SNRIs (Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors), and SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.\n\n\n\n Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with PRISTIQ. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose, but at a more gradual rate [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.8 Seizure\n\n\n\n  Cases of seizure have been reported in pre-marketing clinical studies with PRISTIQ. PRISTIQ has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. Patients with a history of seizures were excluded from pre-marketing clinical studies. PRISTIQ should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder.\n\n\n\n    5.9 Hyponatremia\n\n\n\n  Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including PRISTIQ. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted can be at greater risk [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.5)  and Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)]  . Discontinuation of PRISTIQ should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted.\n\n\n\n Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.\n\n\n\n    5.10 Interstitial Lung Disease and Eosinophilic Pneumonia\n\n\n\n  Interstitial lung disease and eosinophilic pneumonia associated with venlafaxine (the parent drug of PRISTIQ) therapy have been rarely reported. The possibility of these adverse events should be considered in patients treated with PRISTIQ who present with progressive dyspnea, cough, or chest discomfort. Such patients should undergo a prompt medical evaluation, and discontinuation of PRISTIQ should be considered.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   Review the Full Prescribing Information for trametinib prior to initiation of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib. The following serious adverse reactions of trametinib as a single agent, which may occur when TAFINLAR is used in combination with trametinib, are not described in the Full Prescribing Information for TAFINLAR:  \n\n\n\n *     Retinal vein occlusion  \n *     Interstitial lung disease  \n   *    New primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur when TAFINLAR is administered as a single agent or in combination with trametinib. Monitor patients for new malignancies prior to initiation of therapy, while on therapy, and following discontinuation of TAFINLAR or the combination therapy. (  5.1  ,  2.3  ) \n *    Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Melanoma: Increased cell proliferation can occur with BRAF inhibitors. (  5.2  ) \n *    Hemorrhage: Major hemorrhagic events can occur in patients receiving TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. (  5.3  ) \n *    Venous Thromboembolism: Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can occur in patients receiving TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib. (  5.4  ,  2.3  ) \n *    Cardiomyopathy: Assess LVEF before treatment with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib, after one month of treatment, then every 2 to 3 months thereafter. (  5.5  ,  2.3  ) \n *    Ocular Toxicities: Perform ophthalmologic evaluation for any visual disturbances. (  5.6  ,  2.3  ) \n *    Serious Febrile Reactions: Incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib. (  5.7  ,  2.3  ) \n *    Serious Skin Toxicity: Monitor for skin toxicities and for secondary infections. Discontinue for intolerable Grade 2, or Grade 3 or 4 rash not improving within 3 weeks despite interruption of TAFINLAR. (  5.8  ,  2.3  ) \n *    Hyperglycemia: Monitor serum glucose levels in patients with pre-existing diabetes or hyperglycemia. (  5.9  ) \n *    Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency: Closely monitor for hemolytic anemia. (  5.10  ) \n *    Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus. TAFINLAR may render hormonal contraceptives less effective and an alternative method of contraception should be used. (  5.11  ,  8.1  ) \n      EXCERPT:   \n \n\n   5.1 New Primary Malignancies\n\n\n\n  New primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur when TAFINLAR is administered as a single agent or when used in combination with trametinib.\n\n\n\n  Cutaneous Malignancies:  \n\n\n\n TAFINLAR results in an increased incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, keratoacanthoma, and melanoma. TAFINLAR when used in combination with trametinib results in an increased incidence of basal cell carcinoma.  \n\n\n\n In Trial 1, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas (cuSCC) occurred in 7% (14/187) of patients treated with TAFINLAR and in none of the patients treated with dacarbazine.\n\n\n\n Across clinical trials of TAFINLAR (N = 586), the incidence of cuSCC was 11%. The median time to first cuSCC was 9 weeks (range: 1 to 53 weeks). Of those patients who developed new cuSCC, approximately 33% developed one or more cuSCC with continued administration of TAFINLAR. The median time between diagnosis of the first cuSCC and the second cuSCC was 6 weeks.\n\n\n\n In Trial 1, the incidence of new primary malignant melanomas was 2% (3/187) for patients receiving TAFINLAR while no dacarbazine-treated patient was diagnosed with new primary malignant melanoma.\n\n\n\n  In Trial 2, the incidence of basal cell carcinoma was increased in patients receiving TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib: 9% (5/55) of patients receiving TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib compared with 2% (1/53) of patients receiving TAFINLAR as a single agent. The range of time to diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma was 28 to 249 days in patients receiving TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib and was 197 days for the patient receiving TAFINLAR as a single agent.  \n\n\n\n  Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), including keratoacanthoma, occurred in 7% of patients receiving TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib and 19% of patients receiving TAFINLAR as a single agent. The range of time to diagnosis of cuSCC was 136 to197 days in the combination arm and was 9 to 197 days in the arm receiving TAFINLAR as a single agent.  \n\n\n\n  New primary melanoma occurred in 2% (1/53) of patients receiving TAFINLAR as a single agent and in none of the 55 patients receiving TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib.  \n\n\n\n  Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiation of TAFINLAR as a single agent or in combination with trametinib, every 2 months while on therapy, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of TAFINLAR. No dose modifications of TAFINLAR or trametinib are required in patients who develop new primary cutaneous malignancies.  \n\n\n\n   Non-cutaneous Malignancies:    \n\n\n\n  Based on its mechanism of action, TAFINLAR may promote the growth and development of malignancies with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]  . In patients receiving TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib four cases of non-cutaneous malignancies were identified: KRAS mutation-positive pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 1), recurrent NRAS mutation-positive colorectal carcinoma (n = 1), head and neck carcinoma (n = 1), and glioblastoma (n = 1). Monitor patients receiving the combination closely for signs or symptoms of non-cutaneous malignancies. Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR for RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies. If used in combination with trametinib, no dose modification of trametinib is required for patients who develop non-cutaneous malignancies.  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Melanoma\n\n\n\n  In vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells which are exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of BRAF V600E or V600K  mutation status prior to initiation of TAFINLAR as  a single agent or combination therapy   [see Indications and Usage (1), Dosage and Administration (2.1)]  .\n\n\n\n     5.3 Hemorrhage  \n\n\n\n   Hemorrhages, including major hemorrhages defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, can occur when TAFINLAR is used in combination with trametinib.  \n\n\n\n  In Trial 2, treatment with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib resulted in an increased incidence and severity of any hemorrhagic event: 16% (9/55) of patients treated with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib compared with 2% (1/53) of patients treated with TAFINLAR as a single agent. The major hemorrhagic events of intracranial or gastric hemorrhage occurred in 5% (3/55) of patients treated with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib compared with none of the 53 patients treated with TAFINLAR as a single agent. Intracranial hemorrhage was fatal in 4% (2/55) of patients receiving TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib.  \n\n\n\n  Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR and trametinib for all Grade 4 hemorrhagic events and for any Grade 3 hemorrhagic events that do not improve. Withhold TAFINLAR for Grade 3 hemorrhagic events; if improved resume at a lower dose level. Withhold trametinib for up to 3 weeks for Grade 3 hemorrhagic events; if improved, resume at a lower dose level.  \n\n\n\n     5.4 Venous Thromboembolism  \n\n\n\n   Venous thromboembolism can occur when TAFINLAR is used in combination with trametinib.  \n\n\n\n  In Trial 2, treatment with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib resulted in an increased incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): 7% (4/55) of patients treated with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib compared with none of the 53 patients treated with TAFINLAR as a single agent. Pulmonary embolism was fatal in 2% (1/55) of patients receiving TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib.  \n\n\n\n  Advise patients to immediately seek medical care if they develop symptoms of DVT or PE, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Permanently discontinue TAFINLAR and trametinib for life-threatening PE. Withhold trametinib and continue TAFINLAR at the same dose for uncomplicated DVT or PE; if improved within 3 weeks, trametinib may be resumed at a lower dose level [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]    .\n\n\n\n     5.5 Cardiomyopathy  \n\n\n\n   Cardiomyopathy can occur when TAFINLAR is used in combination with trametinib and with trametinib as a single agent [refer to Full Prescribing Information for trametinib]  .  \n\n\n\n  In Trial 2, cardiomyopathy occurred in 9% (5/55) of patients treated with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib and in none of patients treated with TAFINLAR as a single agent. The median time to onset of cardiomyopathy in patients treated with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib was 86 days (range: 27 to 253 days). Cardiomyopathy was identified within the first month of treatment with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib in two of five patients. Development of cardiomyopathy resolved in all five patients following dose reduction (4/55) and/or dose interruption (1/55).  \n\n\n\n  Across clinical trials of TAFINLAR administered in combination with trametinib (N = 202), 8% of patients developed evidence of cardiomyopathy (decrease in LVEF below institutional lower limits of normal with an absolute decrease in LVEF >=10% below baseline). Two percent demonstrated a decrease in LVEF below institutional lower limits of normal with an absolute decrease in LVEF of >=20% below baseline.  \n\n\n\n  Assess LVEF by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan before initiation of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib, one month after initiation, and then at 2- to 3-month intervals while on treatment with the combination. Withhold treatment with trametinib and continue TAFINLAR at the same dose if absolute LVEF value decreases by 10% from pretreatment values and is less than the lower limit of normal. For symptomatic cardiomyopathy or persistent, asymptomatic LV dysfunction that does not resolve within 4 weeks, permanently discontinue trametinib and withhold TAFINLAR. Resume TAFINLAR at the same dose level upon recovery of cardiac function [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]    .\n\n\n\n     5.6 Ocular Toxicities  \n\n\n\n    Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachment (RPED):    \n\n\n\n  Retinal pigment epithelial detachments (RPED) can occur when TAFINLAR is used in combination with trametinib and with trametinib as a single agent [refer to Full Prescribing Information for trametinib]  . Retinal detachments resulting from trametinib are often bilateral and multifocal, occurring in the macular region of the retina.  \n\n\n\n  In Trial 2, ophthalmologic examinations including retinal evaluation were performed pretreatment and at regular intervals during treatment. RPED occurred in 2% (1/55) of patients receiving TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib. Across clinical trials of TAFINLAR administered in combination with trametinib (N = 202), the incidence of RPED was 1% (2/202).  \n\n\n\n  Perform ophthalmological evaluation at any time a patient reports visual disturbances and compare with baseline, if available. If TAFINLAR is used in combination with trametinib, do not modify the dose of TAFINLAR. Withhold trametinib if RPED is diagnosed. If resolution of the RPED is documented on repeat ophthalmological evaluation within 3 weeks, resume trametinib at a lower dose level. Discontinue trametinib if no improvement after 3 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].    \n\n\n\n   Uveitis and Iritis:    \n\n\n\n  Uveitis and iritis can occur when TAFINLAR is administered as a single agent or when used in combination with trametinib.  \n\n\n\n  Uveitis (including iritis) occurred in 1% (6/586) of patients treated with TAFINLAR as a single agent and uveitis occurred in 1% (2/202) of patients treated with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib. Symptomatic treatment employed in clinical trials included steroid and mydriatic ophthalmic drops. Monitor patients for visual signs and symptoms of uveitis (e.g., change in vision, photophobia, eye pain). If diagnosed, withhold TAFINLAR for up to 6 weeks until uveitis/iritis resolves to Grade 0-1. If TAFINLAR is used in combination with trametinib, do not modify the dose of trametinib.  \n\n\n\n    5.7 Serious Febrile Reactions\n\n\n\n   Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure, can occur when TAFINLAR is administered as a single agent or when used in combination with trametinib. The incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased when TAFINLAR is used in combination with trametinib compared with TAFINLAR as a single agent [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].    \n\n\n\n In Trial 1, the incidence of fever (serious and non-serious) was 28% in patients treated with TAFINLAR and 10% in patients treated with dacarbazine. In patients treated with TAFINLAR, the median time to initial onset of fever (any severity) was 11 days (range: 1 to 202 days) and the median duration of fever was 3 days (range: 1 to 129 days). Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills occurred in 3.7% (7/187) of patients treated with TAFINLAR and in none of the 59 patients treated with dacarbazine.  \n\n\n\n  In Trial 2, the incidence of fever (serious and non-serious) was 71% (39/55) in patients treated with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib and 26% (14/53) in patients treated with TAFINLAR as a single agent. Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills occurred in 25% (14/55) of patients treated with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib compared with 2% (1/53) of patients treated with TAFINLAR as a single agent. Fever was complicated with chills/rigors in 51% (28/55), dehydration in 9% (5/55), renal failure in 4% (2/55), and syncope in 4% (2/55) of patients in Trial 2.  \n\n\n\n  In patients treated with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib, the median time to initial onset of fever was 30 days compared with 19 days in patients treated with TAFINLAR as a single agent; the median duration of fever was 6 days with the combination compared with 4 days with TAFINLAR as a single agent.  \n\n\n\n  Across clinical trials of TAFINLAR administered in combination with trametinib (N = 202), the incidence of pyrexia was 57% (116/202).  \n\n\n\n Withhold TAFINLAR for fever of 101.3oF or higher. Withhold trametinib for any fever higher than 104oF. Withhold TAFINLAR, and trametinib if used in combination, for any serious febrile reaction or fever complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure and evaluate for signs and symptoms of infection. Refer to Table 2 for recommended dose modifications for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].  Prophylaxis with antipyretics may be required when resuming TAFINLAR or trametinib.  \n\n\n\n     5.8 Serious Skin Toxicity  \n\n\n\n   Serious skin toxicity can occur when TAFINLAR is used in combination with trametinib and with trametinib as a single agent [refer to Full Prescribing Information for trametinib]  .  \n\n\n\n  In Trial 2, the incidence of any skin toxicity was similar for patients receiving TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib (65% [36/55]) compared with patients receiving TAFINLAR as a single agent (68% [36/53]). The median time to onset of skin toxicity in patients treated with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib was 37 days (range: 1 to 225 days) and median time to resolution of skin toxicity was 33 days (range: 3 to 421 days). No patient required dose reduction or permanent discontinuation of TAFINLAR or trametinib for skin toxicity.  \n\n\n\n  Across clinical trials of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib (N = 202), severe skin toxicity and secondary infections of the skin requiring hospitalization occurred in 2.5% (5/202) of patients treated with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib.  \n\n\n\n  Withhold TAFINLAR, and trametinib if used in combination, for intolerable or severe skin toxicity. TAFINLAR and trametinib may be resumed at lower dose levels in patients with improvement or recovery from skin toxicity within 3 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.9 Hyperglycemia\n\n\n\n   Hyperglycemia can occur when TAFINLAR is administered as a single agent or when used in combination with trametinib  .\n\n\n\n In Trial 1, 5 of 12 patients with a history of diabetes required more intensive hypoglycemic therapy while taking TAFINLAR. The incidence of Grade 3 hyperglycemia based on laboratory values was 6% (12/187) in patients treated with TAFINLAR compared with none of the dacarbazine-treated patients.\n\n\n\n  In Trial 2, the incidence of Grade 3 hyperglycemia based on laboratory values was 5% (3/55) in patients treated with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib compared with 2% (1/53) in patients treated with TAFINLAR as a single agent.  \n\n\n\n  Monitor serum glucose levels as clinically appropriate when TAFINLAR is administered as a single agent or when used in combination with trametinib in patients with pre-existing diabetes or hyperglycemia. Advise patients to report symptoms of severe hyperglycemia such as excessive thirst or any increase in the volume or frequency of urination  .\n\n\n\n    5.10 Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency\n\n\n\n  TAFINLAR, which contains a sulfonamide moiety, confers a potential risk of hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Closely observe patients with G6PD deficiency for signs of hemolytic anemia.\n\n\n\n    5.11 Embryofetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Based on its mechanism of action, TAFINLAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Dabrafenib was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats at doses three times greater than the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]  .\n\n\n\n Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use a highly effective non-hormonal method of contraception since TAFINLAR can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective , during treatment and for at least 2 weeks after treatment with TAFINLAR or for 4 months after treatment with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib  . Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking TAFINLAR [see Drug Interactions (7.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].  \n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Determine cardiac rhythm at least once every 3 months. If AF is detected discontinue MULTAQ or cardiovert (  5.2  ) \n *    Ensure appropriate antithrombotic therapy prior to and throughout MULTAQ use (  5.3  ) \n *    Liver injury: if hepatic injury is suspected, discontinue MULTAQ (  5.5  ) \n *    If pulmonary toxicity is confirmed, discontinue treatment (  5.6  ) \n *    Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia: Maintain potassium and magnesium levels within the normal range (  5.7  ) \n *    Renal Impairment: Monitor renal function periodically (  5.9  ) \n *    Teratogen: Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while using MULTAQ (  5.10  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Cardiovascular Death in NYHA Class IV or Decompensated Heart Failure\n\n\n\n  MULTAQ is contraindicated in patients with NYHA Class IV heart failure or symptomatic heart failure with recent decompensation requiring hospitalization because it doubles the risk of death.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Cardiovascular Death and Heart Failure in Permanent AF\n\n\n\n  MULTAQ doubles the risk of cardiovascular death (largely arrhythmic) and heart failure events in patients with permanent AF. Patients treated with dronedarone should undergo monitoring of cardiac rhythm no less often than every 3 months. Cardiovert patients who are in atrial fibrillation (if clinically indicated) or discontinue MULTAQ. MULTAQ offers no benefit in subjects in permanent AF.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Increased Risk of Stroke in Permanent AF\n\n\n\n  In a placebo-controlled study in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation, dronedarone was associated with an increased risk of stroke, particularly in the first two weeks of therapy [   see Clinical Studies (14.4)    ]. MULTAQ should only be initiated in patients in sinus rhythm who are receiving appropriate antithrombotic therapy [ see  Drug interactions (7.3)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.4 New Onset or Worsening Heart Failure\n\n\n\n  New onset or worsening of heart failure has been reported during treatment with MULTAQ in the postmarketing setting. In a placebo controlled study in patients with permanent AF increased rates of heart failure were observed in patients with normal left ventricular function and no history of symptomatic heart failure, as well as those with a history of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction.\n\n\n\n Advise patients to consult a physician if they develop signs or symptoms of heart failure, such as weight gain, dependent edema, or increasing shortness of breath. If heart failure develops or worsens and requires hospitalization, discontinue MULTAQ.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Liver Injury\n\n\n\n    *     Hepatocellular liver injury, including acute liver failure requiring transplant, has been reported in patients treated with MULTAQ in the postmarketing setting. Advise patients treated with MULTAQ to report immediately symptoms suggesting hepatic injury (such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, malaise, fatigue, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, dark urine, or itching). Consider obtaining periodic hepatic serum enzymes, especially during the first 6 months of treatment, but it is not known whether routine periodic monitoring of serum enzymes will prevent the development of severe liver injury. If hepatic injury is suspected, promptly discontinue MULTAQ and test serum enzymes, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase, as well as serum bilirubin, to establish whether there is liver injury. If liver injury is found, institute appropriate treatment and investigate the probable cause. Do not restart MULTAQ in patients without another explanation for the observed liver injury. \n       5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity\n \n\n  Cases of interstitial lung disease including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in patients treated with MULTAQ in the post-marketing setting [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  . Onset of dyspnea or non-productive cough may be related to pulmonary toxicity and patients should be carefully evaluated clinically. If pulmonary toxicity is confirmed, MULTAQ should be discontinued.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Hypokalemia and Hypomagnesemia with Potassium-Depleting Diuretics\n\n\n\n  Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may occur with concomitant administration of potassium-depleting diuretics. Potassium levels should be within the normal range prior to administration of MULTAQ and maintained in the normal range during administration of MULTAQ.\n\n\n\n    5.8 QT Interval Prolongation\n\n\n\n  Dronedarone induces a moderate (average of about 10 ms but much greater effects have been observed) QTc (Bazett) prolongation [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  and  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . If the QTc Bazett interval is >=500 ms, discontinue MULTAQ [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.9 Renal Impairment and Failure\n\n\n\n   Marked increase in serum creatinine, pre-renal azotemia and acute renal failure, often in the setting of heart failure [ see       Warnings and Precautions (5.4)     ] or hypovolemia, have been reported in patients taking MULTAQ. In most cases, these effects appear to be reversible upon drug discontinuation and with appropriate medical treatment. Monitor renal function periodically.  \n\n\n\n Small increases in creatinine levels (about 0.1 mg/dL) following dronedarone treatment initiation have been shown to be a result of inhibition of creatinine's tubular secretion. The elevation has a rapid onset, reaches a plateau after 7 days and is reversible after discontinuation.\n\n\n\n    5.10 Women of Childbearing Potential\n\n\n\n  Premenopausal women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or oophorectomy must use effective contraception while using MULTAQ. Dronedarone caused fetal harm in animal studies at doses equivalent to recommended human doses. Counsel women of childbearing potential regarding appropriate contraceptive choices [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .\n",

(5.6) \n    \n   5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors\n\n    Carcinogenicity of albiglutide could not be assessed in rodents due to the rapid development of drug-clearing, anti-drug antibodies  [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]  . Other GLP-1 receptor agonists have caused dose-related and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas or carcinomas) in rodents. Human relevance of GLP-1 receptor agonist induced C-cell tumors in rodents has not been determined. It is unknown whether TANZEUM causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including MTC, in humans  [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4.1)]  .  \n\n\n\n   Across 8 Phase III clinical trials  [see Clinical Studies (14)]  , MTC was diagnosed in 1 patient receiving TANZEUM and 1 patient receiving placebo. Both patients had markedly elevated serum calcitonin levels at baseline. Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.  \n\n\n\n   TANZEUM is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of TANZEUM and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, or persistent hoarseness).  \n\n\n\n   Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with TANZEUM. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low specificity of serum calcitonin testing for MTC and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.  \n\n\n\n   5.2 Acute Pancreatitis\n\n  In clinical trials, acute pancreatitis has been reported in association with TANZEUM.\n\n\n\n Across 8 Phase III clinical trials  [see Clinical Studies (14)]  , pancreatitis adjudicated as likely related to therapy occurred more frequently in patients receiving TANZEUM (6 of 2,365 [0.3%]) than in patients receiving placebo (0 of 468 [0%]) or active comparators (2 of 2,065 [0.1%]).\n\n\n\n After initiation of TANZEUM, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue TANZEUM. If pancreatitis is confirmed, TANZEUM should not be restarted.\n\n\n\n TANZEUM has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis to determine whether these patients are at increased risk for pancreatitis. Consider other antidiabetic therapies in patients with a history of pancreatitis.\n\n\n\n   5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin\n\n  The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when TANZEUM is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) or insulin. Therefore, patients may require a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in this setting  [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .\n\n\n\n   5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n  Across 8 Phase III clinical trials  [see Clinical Studies (14)]  , a serious hypersensitivity reaction with pruritus, rash, and dyspnea occurred in a patient treated with TANZEUM. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of TANZEUM; treat promptly per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve  [see Contraindications (4.2)]  .\n\n\n\n   5.5 Renal Impairment\n\n  In patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, there have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis. Some of these events were reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration. In a trial of TANZEUM in patients with renal impairment  [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]  , the frequency of such gastrointestinal reactions increased as renal function declined  [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]  . Because these reactions may worsen renal function, use caution when initiating or escalating doses of TANZEUM in patients with renal impairment  [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].  \n\n\n\n   5.6 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\n  There have been no clinical trials establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with TANZEUM or any other antidiabetic drug.\n",

(   2.2  ,  5.1   ) \n *    Infection: Serious and fatal infections (e.g., pneumonia and sepsis). (   5.2   ) \n *    Hepatotoxicity: Beleodaq may cause hepatic toxicity and liver function test abnormalities. Monitor liver function tests and omit or modify dosage for hepatic toxicities. (   2.2  ,  5.3   ) \n *    Tumor lysis syndrome: Monitor patients with advanced stage disease and/or high tumor burden and take appropriate precautions. (   5.4   ) \n *    Embryo-fetal toxicity: Beleodaq may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of potential harm to the fetus and to avoid pregnancy while receiving Beleodaq. (   5.6   ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hematologic Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Beleodaq can cause thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (neutropenia and lymphopenia), and/or anemia; monitor blood counts weekly during treatment, and modify dosage as necessary  [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2    ) and Adverse Reactions   (  6.1  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Infections\n\n\n\n  Serious and sometimes fatal infections, including pneumonia and sepsis, have occurred with Beleodaq. Do not administer Beleodaq to patients with an active infection. Patients with a history of extensive or intensive chemotherapy may be at higher risk of life threatening infections [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Hepatotoxicity\n\n\n\n  Beleodaq can cause fatal hepatotoxicity and liver function test abnormalities  [see Adverse Reactions  (   6.1  )]  . Monitor liver function tests before treatment and before the start of each cycle. Interrupt or adjust dosage until recovery, or permanently discontinue Beleodaq based on the severity of the hepatic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (     2.2)     ].  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Tumor lysis syndrome has occurred in Beleodaq-treated patients in the clinical trial of patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL  [see    Clinical Studies  (   14    ) ]  . Monitor patients with advanced stage disease and/or high tumor burden and take appropriate precautions  [see    Adverse Reactions  (   6.1    ) ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Gastrointestinal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea occur with Beleodaq  [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  and may require the use of antiemetic and antidiarrheal medications.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Embryo-fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Beleodaq can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Beleodaq may cause teratogenicity and/or embryo-fetal lethality because it is genotoxic and targets actively dividing cells  [see Nonclinical Toxicology  (   13.1    ) ]  . Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy while receiving Beleodaq. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of potential hazard to the fetus  [see Use in Specific Populations  (   8.1    ) ]  .\n",

        "section_text": "     5   WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *   Neutropenia : Monitor peripheral blood cell counts and adjust dose as appropriate (  2.2  ,  5.1  ,  6  ) \n *   Peripheral Neuropathy : Monitor for signs of neuropathy. Manage with dose delay and adjustment (  2.2  ,  5.2  ,  6  ) \n *   Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman (  5.3  ) (  8.1  ) \n *   QT Prolongation : Monitor for prolonged QT intervals in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, drugs known to prolong the QT interval, and electrolyte abnormalities. Avoid in patients with congenital long QT syndrome (  5.4  ) \n    \n \n\n    5.1   Neutropenia  \n\n\n\n  Severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm  3  ) lasting more than one week occurred in 12% (62/503) of patients in Study 1, leading to discontinuation in <1% of patients [ see Adverse Reactions (     6     )  ]. Patients with alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase > 3 * ULN (upper limit of normal) experienced a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia than patients with normal aminotransferase levels. Patients with bilirubin > 1.5 * ULN also had a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia.\n\n\n\n Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose; increase the frequency of monitoring in patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias. Delay administration of HALAVEN and reduce subsequent doses in patients who experience febrile neutropenia or Grade 4 neutropenia lasting longer than 7 days [ see Dosage and Administration (     2.2     )  ]. Clinical studies of HALAVEN did not include patients with baseline neutrophil counts below 1,500/mm  3  .\n\n\n\n     5.2   Peripheral Neuropathy  \n\n\n\n  Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 8% (40/503) of patients, and Grade 4 in 0.4% (2/503) of patients in Study 1. Peripheral neuropathy was the most common toxicity leading to discontinuation of HALAVEN (5% of patients; 24/503). Neuropathy lasting more than one year occurred in 5% (26/503) of patients. Twenty-two percent (109/503) of patients developed a new or worsening neuropathy that had not recovered within a median follow-up duration of 269 days (range 25-662 days). Monitor patients closely for signs of peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy. Withhold HALAVEN in patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy until resolution to Grade 2 or less [ see    Dosage and Administration (     2.2     )  ].\n\n\n\n     5.3   Embryo-Fetal Toxicity  \n\n\n\n  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of HALAVEN in pregnant women. HALAVEN is a microtubule inhibitor; therefore, it is expected to cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Embryo-fetal toxicity and teratogenicity occurred in rats that received eribulin mesylate at approximately half of the recommended human dose based on body surface area. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (     8.1     )]  .\n\n\n\n     5.4   QT Prolongation  \n\n\n\n  In an uncontrolled open-label ECG study in 26 patients, QT prolongation was observed on Day 8, independent of eribulin concentration, with no QT prolongation observed on Day 1. ECG monitoring is recommended if therapy is initiated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, and electrolyte abnormalities. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating HALAVEN and monitor these electrolytes periodically during therapy. Avoid HALAVEN in patients with congenital long QT syndrome.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Tendon rupture or serious injury to the injected finger/hand: Avoid injecting XIAFLEX into tendons, nerves, blood vessels, or other collagen-containing structure of the hand. Injection into these structures may result in possible permanent injury, such as tendon rupture or ligament damage, or skin laceration. (  5.1  ) \n *  Corporal rupture (penile fracture) or other serious injury to the penis: Avoid injecting into the urethra, nerves, blood vessels, corpora cavernosa or other collagen-containing structures of the penis. Injection into these structures may result in possible permanent injury such as corporal rupture (penile fracture). (  5.2  ) \n *  Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis: Healthcare providers should be prepared to address hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, following XIAFLEX injections. (  5.4  ) \n *  Patients with abnormal coagulation: Use with caution, including in patients who have received anticoagulant medications other than low-dose aspirin within 7 days of the injection. (  5.5  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Tendon Rupture or Other Serious Injury to the Injected Finger/Hand in the Treatment of Dupuytren's Contracture\n\n\n\n  In the controlled and uncontrolled portions of clinical trials in Dupuytren's contracture, flexor tendon ruptures occurred after XIAFLEX injection   [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]    . Injection of XIAFLEX into collagen-containing structures such as tendons or ligaments of the hand may result in damage to those structures and possible permanent injury such as tendon rupture or ligament damage. Therefore, XIAFLEX should be injected only into the collagen cord with a MP or PIP joint contracture, and care should be taken to avoid injecting into tendons, nerves, blood vessels, or other collagen-containing structures of the hand. When injecting a cord affecting a PIP joint of the fifth finger, the needle insertion should not be more than 2 to 3 mm in depth and avoid injecting more than 4 mm distal to the palmar digital crease   [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]    .\n\n\n\n  Other XIAFLEX-associated serious local adverse reactions included pulley rupture, ligament injury, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), sensory abnormality of the hand, and skin laceration (tear). In a historically controlled post-marketing trial, the incidence of skin laceration (22%) was higher for subjects treated with two concurrent injections of XIAFLEX compared with subjects treated with up to three single injections in the placebo-controlled premarketing trials (9%). Cases of skin laceration requiring skin graft after finger extension procedures have been reported post-marketing. Signs or symptoms that may reflect serious injury to the injected finger/hand should be promptly evaluated because surgical intervention may be required.  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Corporal Rupture (Penile Fracture) or Other Serious Injury to the Penis in the Treatment of Peyronie's Disease\n\n\n\n  Corporal rupture was reported as an adverse reaction after XIAFLEX injections in 5 of 1044 (0.5%) XIAFLEX treated patients in the controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in Peyronie's disease.\n\n\n\n In other XIAFLEX-treated patients (9 of 1044; 0.9%), a combination of penile ecchymoses or hematoma, sudden penile detumescence, and/or a penile \"popping\" sound or sensation was reported, and in these cases, a diagnosis of corporal rupture can not be excluded. These patients were managed without surgical intervention, but the long-term consequences are unknown.\n\n\n\n Severe penile hematoma was also reported as an adverse reaction in 39 of 1044 patients (3.7%) in the controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in Peyronie's disease [ see Adverse Reactions (  6  )  ].\n\n\n\n Signs or symptoms that may reflect serious injury to the penis should be promptly evaluated in order to assess for corporal rupture or severe penile hematoma, which may require surgical intervention.\n\n\n\n Injection of XIAFLEX into collagen-containing structures such as the corpora cavernosa of the penis may result in damage to those structures and possible injury such as corporal rupture (penile fracture). Therefore, XIAFLEX should be injected only into the Peyronie's plaque and care should be taken to avoid injecting into the urethra, nerves, blood vessels, corpora cavernosa or other collagen-containing structures of the penis.\n\n\n\n    5.3 XIAFLEX REMS Program\n\n\n\n  Because of the risks of corporal rupture (penile fracture) or other serious penile injury in the treatment of Peyronie's disease, XIAFLEX is available only through the XIAFLEX REMS Program      [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]  .  \n\n\n\n Required components of the XIAFLEX REMS Program  include the following:\n\n\n\n *  Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training in the administration of XIAFLEX treatment for Peyronie's disease. \n *  Healthcare sites must be certified with the program and ensure that XIAFLEX is only dispensed for use by certified prescribers. \n    Further information is available at www.XIAFLEXREMS.com or 1-877-313-1235.\n \n\n    5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis\n\n\n\n  In the controlled portions of the clinical trials in Dupuytren's contracture (Studies 1 and 2), a greater proportion of XIAFLEX-treated patients (15%) compared to placebo-treated patients (1%) had mild allergic reactions (pruritus) after up to 3 injections. The incidence of XIAFLEX-associated pruritus increased after more XIAFLEX injections in patients with Dupuytren's contracture.\n\n\n\n  In the double-blind, placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Peyronie's disease (Studies 1 and 2), a greater proportion of XIAFLEX-treated patients (4%) compared to placebo-treated patients (1%) had localized pruritus after up to 4 treatment cycles (involving up to 8 XIAFLEX injection procedures). The incidence of XIAFLEX-associated pruritus was similar after each injection regardless of the number of injections administered.  \n\n\n\n  Because XIAFLEX contains foreign proteins, severe allergic reactions to XIAFLEX can occur. Anaphylaxis was reported in a post-marketing clinical trial (Study 3) in one patient who had previous exposure to XIAFLEX for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. Some patients with Dupuytren's contracture developed IgE-anti-drug antibodies in greater proportions and higher titers with successive XIAFLEX injections. Healthcare providers should be prepared to address severe allergic reactions following XIAFLEX injections.  \n\n\n\n    5.5 Risk of bleeding in Patients with Abnormal Coagulation\n\n\n\n  In the XIAFLEX trials in Dupuytren's contracture (Studies 1 and 2), 70% and 38% of XIAFLEX-treated patients developed an ecchymosis/contusion or an injection site hemorrhage, respectively (see Table 3). In the XIAFLEX controlled trials in Peyronie's disease (Studies 1 and 2), 65.5% of XIAFLEX-treated patients developed penile hematoma, and 14.5% developed penile ecchymosis (see Table 4). Patients with abnormal coagulation (except for patients taking low-dose aspirin, e.g., up to 150 mg per day) were excluded from participating in these studies.\n\n\n\n Therefore, the efficacy and safety of XIAFLEX in patients receiving anticoagulant medications (other than low-dose aspirin, e.g., up to 150 mg per day) within 7 days prior to XIAFLEX administration is not known. In addition, it is recommended to avoid use of XIAFLEX in patients with coagulation disorders, including patients receiving concomitant anticoagulants (except for low-dose aspirin).\n",

If an infection develops, monitor carefully, and stop CIMZIA if infection becomes serious (  5.1  ) \n *  Invasive fungal infections - for patients who develop a systemic illness on CIMZIA, consider empiric antifungal therapy for those who reside or travel to regions where mycoses are endemic (  5.1  ) \n *  Cases of lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed among patients receiving TNF blockers (  5.2  ) \n *  Heart failure, worsening or new onset may occur (  5.3  ) \n *  Anaphylaxis or serious allergic reactions may occur (  5.4  ) \n *  Hepatitis B virus reactivation - test for HBV infection before starting CIMZIA. Monitor HBV carriers during and several months after therapy. If reactivation occurs, stop CIMZIA and begin anti-viral therapy (  5.5  ) \n *  Demyelinating disease, exacerbation or new onset, may occur (  5.6  ) \n *  Cytopenias, pancytopenia - advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms develop, and consider stopping CIMZIA (  5.7  ) \n *  Lupus-like syndrome - stop CIMZIA if syndrome develops (  5.9  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Risk of Serious Infections\n\n\n\n   [see  Boxed Warning  ]  \n\n\n\n Patients treated with CIMZIA are at an increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death.\n\n\n\n Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease.\n\n\n\n Treatment with CIMZIA should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including clinically important localized infections. Patients greater than 65 years of age, patients with co-morbid conditions, and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants (e.g. corticosteroids or methotrexate) may be at a greater risk of infection. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating therapy in patients:\n\n\n\n *  with chronic or recurrent infection \n *  who have been exposed to tuberculosis \n *  with a history of an opportunistic infection \n *  who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis \n *  with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection \n       Tuberculosis  \n \n\n Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis or new tuberculosis infections have been observed in patients receiving CIMZIA, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors and tested for latent infection prior to initiating CIMZIA and periodically during therapy.\n\n\n\n Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF-blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Induration of 5 mm or greater with tuberculin skin testing should be considered a positive test result when assessing if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed prior to initiating CIMZIA, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG).\n\n\n\n Anti-tuberculosis therapy should also be considered prior to initiation of CIMZIA in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision of whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.\n\n\n\n Tuberculosis should be strongly considered in patients who develop a new infection during CIMZIA treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis.\n\n\n\n    Monitoring  \n\n\n\n Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with CIMZIA, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with CIMZIA.\n\n\n\n CIMZIA should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with CIMZIA should be closely monitored, undergo a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated.\n\n\n\n    Invasive Fungal Infections  \n\n\n\n For patients who reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, invasive fungal infection should be suspected if they develop a serious systemic illness. Appropriate empiric antifungal therapy should be considered while a diagnostic workup is being performed. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. When feasible, the decision to administer empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections and should take into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and risks of antifungal therapy.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Malignancies\n\n\n\n  In the controlled portions of clinical studies of some TNF blockers, more cases of malignancies have been observed among patients receiving TNF blockers compared to control patients. During controlled and open-labeled portions of CIMZIA studies of Crohn's disease and other diseases, malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 0.5 (0.4, 0.7) per 100 patient-years among 4,650 CIMZIA-treated patients versus a rate of 0.6 (0.1, 1.7) per 100 patient-years among 1,319 placebo-treated patients. The size of the control group and limited duration of the controlled portions of the studies precludes the ability to draw firm conclusions.\n\n\n\n  Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blocking agents (initiation of therapy <= 18 years of age), of which CIMZIA is a member. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months of therapy (range 1 to 84 months). Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post-marketing and are derived from a variety of sources including registries and spontaneous post-marketing reports. CIMZIA is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.  \n\n\n\n In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF blockers, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving TNF blockers compared to control patients. In controlled studies of CIMZIA for Crohn's disease and other investigational uses, there was one case of lymphoma among 2,657 Cimzia-treated patients and one case of Hodgkin's lymphoma among 1,319 placebo-treated patients.\n\n\n\n In the CIMZIA RA clinical trials (placebo-controlled and open label) a total of three cases of lymphoma were observed among 2,367 patients. This is approximately 2-fold higher than expected in the general population. Patients with RA, particularly those with highly active disease, are at a higher risk for the development of lymphoma.\n\n\n\n Rates in clinical studies for CIMZIA cannot be compared to the rates of clinical trials of other TNF blockers and may not predict the rates observed when CIMZIA is used in a broader patient population. Patients with Crohn's disease that require chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies may be at higher risk than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF blocker therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . The potential role of TNF blocker therapy in the development of malignancies in adults is not known.\n\n\n\n  Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma that has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers, including CIMZIA. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases occurred in adolescent and young adult males with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine and/or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants. The potential risk of using a TNF blocker in combination with azathioprine or 6-MP should be carefully considered.  \n\n\n\n Cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with post-marketing TNF-blocker use in RA and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with RA may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia.\n\n\n\n  Periodic skin examinations are recommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer.  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Heart Failure\n\n\n\n  Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF blockers, including CIMZIA. CIMZIA has not been formally studied in patients with CHF; however, in clinical studies in patients with CHF with another TNF blocker, worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and increased mortality due to CHF were observed. Exercise caution in patients with heart failure and monitor them carefully [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n   The following symptoms that could be compatible with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported rarely following CIMZIA administration to patients: angioedema, dyspnea, hypotension, rash, serum sickness, and urticaria. Some of these reactions occurred after the first administration of CIMZIA. If such reactions occur, discontinue further administration of CIMZIA and institute appropriate therapy. There are no data on the risks of using CIMZIA in patients who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity reaction towards another TNF blocker; in these patients caution is needed [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.5 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation\n\n\n\n  Use of TNF blockers, including CIMZIA, has been associated with reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation.\n\n\n\n Test patients for HBV infection before initiating treatment with CIMZIA. For patients who test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. Patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with CIMZIA should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy.\n\n\n\n In patients who develop HBV reactivation, discontinue CIMZIA and initiate effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, exercise caution when considering resumption of CIMZIA therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Neurologic Reactions\n\n\n\n  Use of TNF blockers, of which CIMZIA is a member, has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis, and with peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-Barre syndrome . Exercise caution in considering the use of CIMZIA in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders. Rare cases of neurological disorders, including seizure disorder, optic neuritis, and peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients treated with CIMZIA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.7 Hematological Reactions\n\n\n\n  Rare reports of pancytopenia, including aplastic anemia, have been reported with TNF blockers. Adverse reactions of the hematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g., leukopenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia) have been infrequently reported with CIMZIA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . The causal relationship of these events to CIMZIA remains unclear.\n\n\n\n Although no high risk group has been identified, exercise caution in patients being treated with CIMZIA who have ongoing, or a history of, significant hematologic abnormalities. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on CIMZIA. Consider discontinuation of CIMZIA therapy in patients with confirmed significant hematologic abnormalities.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Use with Biological Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (Biological DMARDs)\n\n\n\n  Serious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF blocker, etanercept, with no added benefit compared to etanercept alone. A higher risk of serious infections was also observed in combination use of TNF blockers with abatacept and rituximab. Because of the nature of the adverse events seen with this combination therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the use of CIMZIA in this combination. Therefore, the use of CIMZIA in combination with other biological DMARDs is not recommended [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.9 Autoimmunity\n\n\n\n  Treatment with CIMZIA may result in the formation of autoantibodies and rarely, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome. If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with CIMZIA, discontinue treatment [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.10 Immunizations\n\n\n\n  Patients treated with CIMZIA may receive vaccinations, except for live or live attenuated vaccines. No data are available on the response to live vaccinations or the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving CIMZIA.\n\n\n\n In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, no difference was detected in antibody response to vaccine between CIMZIA and placebo treatment groups when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with CIMZIA. Similar proportions of patients developed protective levels of anti-vaccine antibodies between CIMZIA and placebo treatment groups; however patients receiving CIMZIA and concomitant methotrexate had a lower humoral response compared with patients receiving CIMZIA alone. The clinical significance of this is unknown.\n\n\n\n    5.11 Immunosuppression\n\n\n\n  Since TNF mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune responses, the possibility exists for TNF blockers, including CIMZIA, to affect host defenses against infections and malignancies. The impact of treatment with CIMZIA on the development and course of malignancies, as well as active and/or chronic infections, is not fully understood [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1  ,  5.2  ,  5.5)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . The safety and efficacy of CIMZIA in patients with immunosuppression has not been formally evaluated.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Splenic Rupture: Discontinue GRANIX if suspected (  5.1  ) \n *    Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Monitor for and manage immediately. Discontinue GRANIX if suspected (  5.2  ) \n *    Allergic reactions (angioneurotic edema, dermatitis allergic, drug hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity, rash, pruritic rash and urticaria) (  5.3  ) \n *    Sickle cell crisis: Severe and sometimes fatal crisis can occur. Discontinue GRANIX if suspected (  5.4  ) \n *    Capillary Leak Syndrome: Monitor if symptoms develop and administer standard symptomatic treatment (5.5) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Splenic Rupture\n\n\n\n  Splenic rupture, including fatal cases, can occur following administration of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. In patients who report upper abdominal or shoulder pain after receiving GRANIX, discontinue GRANIX and evaluate for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)\n\n\n\n  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can occur in patients receiving human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress after receiving GRANIX, for ARDS. Discontinue GRANIX in patients with ARDS.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Allergic Reactions\n\n\n\n  Serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis can occur in patients receiving human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. Reactions can occur on initial exposure. The administration of antihistamines, steroids, bronchodilators, and/or epinephrine may reduce the severity of the reactions. Permanently discontinue GRANIX in patients with serious allergic reactions. Do not administer GRANIX to patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to filgrastim or pegfilgrastim.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Use in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease\n\n\n\n  Severe and sometimes fatal sickle cell crises can occur in patients with sickle cell disease receiving human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. Consider the potential risks and benefits prior to the administration of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors in patients with sickle cell disease. Discontinue GRANIX in patients undergoing a sickle cell crisis.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Capillary Leak Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) can occur in patients receiving human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors and is characterized by hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, edema and hemoconcentration. Episodes vary in frequency, severity and may be life-threatening if treatment is delayed. Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Potential for Tumor Growth Stimulatory Effects on Malignant Cells\n\n\n\n  The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor through which GRANIX acts has been found on tumor cell lines. The possibility that GRANIX acts as a growth factor for any tumor type, including myeloid malignancies and myelodysplasia, diseases for which GRANIX is not approved, cannot be excluded.\n",

(5.1) \n *    Paradoxical bronchospasm: Discontinue TUDORZA PRESSAIR and consider other treatments if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs. (5.2) \n *    Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. (5.3) \n *    Worsening of urinary retention may occur. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. (5.4) \n *    Immediate hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue TUDORZA PRESSAIR at once and consider alternatives if immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis, occur. Use with caution in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins. (5.5) \n    \n   5.1 Not for Acute Use\n\n  TUDORZA PRESSAIR is intended as a twice-daily maintenance treatment for COPD and is not indicated for the initial treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm (i.e., rescue therapy).\n\n\n\n   5.2 Paradoxical Bronchospasm\n\n  Inhaled medicines, including TUDORZA PRESSAIR, may cause paradoxical bronchospasm. If this occurs, treatment with TUDORZA PRESSAIR should be stopped and other treatments considered.\n\n\n\n   5.3 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma\n\n  TUDORZA PRESSAIR should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop.\n\n\n\n   5.4 Worsening of Urinary Retention\n\n  TUDORZA PRESSAIR should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop.\n\n\n\n   5.5 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n  Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat), urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, or itching, have occurred after administration of TUDORZA PRESSAIR. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with TUDORZA PRESSAIR should be stopped at once and alternative treatments should be considered. Given the similar structural formula of atropine to aclidinium, patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to atropine should be closely monitored for similar hypersensitivity reactions to TUDORZA PRESSAIR. In addition, TUDORZA PRESSAIR should be used with caution in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Bone marrow suppression (particularly neutropenia) and its clinical consequences (febrile neutropenia, neutropenic infections): Monitor blood counts frequently to determine if dosage modification or initiation of G-CSF is needed. Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF should be considered in patients with high-risk clinical features. Use caution in patients with hemoglobin < 10 g/dL. (  2.2  )(  4  )(  5.1  ) \n *  Hypersensitivity: Severe hypersensitivity reactions can occur. Premedicate with corticosteroids and H2 antagonists. Discontinue infusion immediately if hypersensitivity is observed and treat as indicated. (  4  )(  5.2  ) \n *  Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. Mortality related to diarrhea has been reported. Rehydrate and treat with anti-emetics and anti-diarrheals as needed. If experiencing Grade >= 3 diarrhea, dosage should be modified. (  2.2  ) Deaths have occurred due to gastrointestinal hemorrhage, perforation and neutropenic enterocolitis. Delay or discontinue JEVTANA. (  5.3  ) \n *  Renal failure, including cases with fatal outcomes, has been reported. Identify cause and manage aggressively. (  5.4  ) \n *  Elderly patients: Patients >= 65 years of age were more likely to experience fatal outcomes not related to disease progression and certain adverse reactions, including neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. Monitor closely. (  5.5  )(  6  )(  8.5  ) \n *  Hepatic impairment: Reduce the JEVTANA dose to 20 mg/m  2  in patients with mild hepatic impairment and to 15 mg/m  2  in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. (  2.3  ) \n *  JEVTANA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. (  5.7  )(  8.1  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression\n\n\n\n   Bone marrow suppression manifested as neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia and/or pancytopenia may occur. Neutropenic deaths have been reported. In the randomized trial, five patients (1.3%) experienced fatal infectious adverse events (sepsis or septic shock). All had grade 4 neutropenia and one had febrile neutropenia. One additional patient's death was attributed to neutropenia without a documented infection. Grade 3-4 neutropenia has been observed in 82% of patients treated with JEVTANA in the randomized trial.  \n\n\n\n G-CSF may be administered to reduce the risks of neutropenia complications associated with JEVTANA use. Primary prophylaxis with G-CSF should be considered in patients with high-risk clinical features (age > 65 years, poor performance status, previous episodes of febrile neutropenia, extensive prior radiation ports, poor nutritional status, or other serious comorbidities) that predispose them to increased complications from prolonged neutropenia. Therapeutic use of G-CSF and secondary prophylaxis should be considered in all patients considered to be at increased risk for neutropenia complications.\n\n\n\n Monitoring of complete blood counts is essential on a weekly basis during cycle 1 and before each treatment cycle thereafter so that the dose can be adjusted, if needed [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n JEVTANA is contraindicated in patients with neutrophils <= 1,500/mm  3   [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .\n\n\n\n  Caution is recommended in patients with hemoglobin < 10 g/dl.  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following the initiation of the infusion of JEVTANA, thus facilities and equipment for the treatment of hypotension and bronchospasm should be available. Severe hypersensitivity reactions can occur and may include generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and bronchospasm.\n\n\n\n Premedicate all patients prior to the initiation of the infusion of JEVTANA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  . Observe patients closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the JEVTANA infusion and appropriate therapy. JEVTANA is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to cabazitaxel or to other drugs formulated with polysorbate 80 [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.3 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions\n\n\n\n  Nausea, vomiting and severe diarrhea, at times, may occur. Death related to diarrhea and electrolyte imbalance occurred in the randomized clinical trial. Intensive measures may be required for severe diarrhea and electrolyte imbalance. Antiemetic prophylaxis is recommended. Treat patients with rehydration, anti-diarrheal or anti-emetic medications as needed. Treatment delay or dosage reduction may be necessary if patients experience Grade >= 3 diarrhea [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].  \n\n\n\n Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage and perforation, ileus, enterocolitis, neutropenic enterocolitis, including fatal outcome, have been reported in patients treated with JEVTANA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  . Risk may be increased with neutropenia, age, steroid use, concomitant use of NSAIDs, anti-platelet therapy or anti-coagulants, and patients with a prior history of pelvic radiotherapy, adhesions, ulceration and GI bleeding.\n\n\n\n Abdominal pain and tenderness, fever, persistent constipation, diarrhea, with or without neutropenia, may be early manifestations of serious gastrointestinal toxicity and should be evaluated and treated promptly. JEVTANA treatment delay or discontinuation may be necessary.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Renal Failure\n\n\n\n  In the randomized clinical trial, renal failure of any grade occurred in 4% of the patients being treated with JEVTANA, including four cases with fatal outcome. Most cases occurred in association with sepsis, dehydration, or obstructive uropathy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Some deaths due to renal failure did not have a clear etiology. Appropriate measures should be taken to identify causes of renal failure and treat aggressively.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Use in Elderly Patients\n\n\n\n  In the randomized clinical trial, 3 of 131 (2%) patients < 65 years of age and 15 of 240 (6%) >= 65 years of age died of causes other than disease progression within 30 days of the last cabazitaxel dose. Patients >= 65 years of age are more likely to experience certain adverse reactions, including neutropenia and febrile neutropenia [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.5)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment\n\n\n\n   Cabazitaxel is extensively metabolized in the liver.  \n\n\n\n  JEVTANA is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 * ULN) [  see   Contraindications (4)  ]  . Dose should be reduced for patients with mild (total bilirubin > 1 to <= 1.5 * ULN or AST > 1.5 * ULN) and moderate (total bilirubin > 1.5 to <= 3.0 * ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment, based on tolerability data in these patients [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  ]  . Administration of cabazitaxel to patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment should be undertaken with caution and close monitoring of safety.  \n\n\n\n    5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  JEVTANA is not indicated for use in female patients.\n\n\n\n JEVTANA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In non-clinical studies in rats and rabbits, cabazitaxel was embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and abortifacient at exposures significantly lower than those expected at the recommended human dose level.\n\n\n\n There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using JEVTANA. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Females of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with JEVTANA [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .\n",

Treatment with medications that work through inhibition of IL-1 has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections. ILARIS has been associated with an increased incidence of serious infections. Physicians should exercise caution when administering ILARIS to patients with infections, a history of recurring infections or underlying conditions which may predispose them to infections. Discontinue treatment with ILARIS if a patient develops a serious infection. Do not administer ILARIS to patients during an active infection requiring medical intervention. (  5.1  ) \n *  Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with ILARIS. Prior to initiation of therapy with ILARIS, patients should receive all recommended vaccinations. (  5.4  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1     Serious Infections\n\n\n\n  ILARIS has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections. Physicians should exercise caution when administering ILARIS to patients with infections, a history of recurring infections or underlying conditions which may predispose them to infections. ILARIS should not be administered to patients during an active infection requiring medical intervention. Administration of ILARIS should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection.\n\n\n\n  Infections, predominantly of the upper respiratory tract, in some instances serious, have been reported with ILARIS. Generally, the observed infections responded to standard therapy. Isolated cases of unusual or opportunistic infections (e.g., aspergillosis, atypical mycobacterial infections, cytomegalovirus, herpes zoster) were reported during ILARIS treatment. A causal relationship of ILARIS to these events cannot be excluded. In clinical trials, ILARIS has not been administered concomitantly with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. An increased incidence of serious infections has been associated with administration of another IL-1 blocker in combination with TNF inhibitors. Coadministration of ILARIS with TNF inhibitors is not recommended because this may increase the risk of serious infections [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]  .  \n\n\n\n Drugs that affect the immune system by blocking TNF have been associated with an increased risk of new tuberculosis and reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB). It is possible that use of IL-1 inhibitors such as ILARIS increases the risk of reactivation of tuberculosis or of opportunistic infections.\n\n\n\n Prior to initiating immunomodulatory therapies, including ILARIS, patients should be evaluated for active and latent tuberculosis infection. Appropriate screening tests should be performed in all patients. ILARIS has not been studied in patients with a positive tuberculosis screen, and the safety of ILARIS in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection is unknown. Patients testing positive in tuberculosis screening should be treated according to standard medical practice prior to therapy with ILARIS. All patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs, symptoms, or high risk exposure suggestive of tuberculosis (e.g., persistent cough, weight loss, subfebrile temperature) appear during or after ILARIS therapy.\n\n\n\n Healthcare providers should follow current CDC guidelines both to evaluate for and to treat possible latent tuberculosis infections before initiating therapy with ILARIS.\n\n\n\n    5.2     Immunosuppression\n\n\n\n  The impact of treatment with anti-interleukin-1 (IL-1) therapy on the development of malignancies is not known. However, treatment with immunosuppressants, including ILARIS, may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies.\n\n\n\n    5.3     Hypersensitivity\n\n\n\n  Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with ILARIS therapy. During clinical trials, no anaphylactic reactions have been reported. It should be recognized that symptoms of the underlying disease being treated may be similar to symptoms of hypersensitivity. ILARIS should not be administered to any patients with known clinical hypersensitivity to ILARIS [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4     Immunizations\n\n\n\n  Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with ILARIS [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]  . Since no data are available on either the efficacy or on the risks of secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving ILARIS, live vaccines should not be given concurrently with ILARIS. In addition, because ILARIS may interfere with normal immune response to new antigens, vaccinations may not be effective in patients receiving ILARIS. No data are available on the effectiveness of vaccinations with inactivated (killed) antigens in patients receiving ILARIS [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]  .\n\n\n\n Because IL-1 blockade may interfere with immune response to infections, it is recommended that prior to initiation of therapy with ILARIS, adult and pediatric patients receive all recommended vaccinations, as appropriate, including pneumococcal vaccine and inactivated influenza vaccine. (See current recommended immunization schedules at the website of the Centers for Disease Control, http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html).\n\n\n\n    5.5     Macrophage Activation Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in patients with rheumatic conditions, in particular SJIA, and should be aggressively treated. Physicians should be attentive to symptoms of infection or worsening of SJIA, as these are known triggers for MAS. Eleven cases of MAS were observed in 201 SJIA patients treated with canakinumab in clinical trials. Based on the clinical trial experience, ILARIS does not appear to increase the incidence of MAS in SJIA patients, but no definitive conclusion can be made.\n",

Discontinue and do not restart AMPYRA if this occurs (  5.4  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Seizures\n\n\n\n  AMPYRA can cause seizures. Increased incidence of seizures has been observed at 20 mg twice daily in controlled clinical studies of 9-14 weeks duration with dalfampridine in patients with MS. In open label extension trials in MS patients, the incidence of seizures during treatment with dalfampridine 15 mg twice daily (1.7/100PY) was over 4 times higher than the incidence during treatment with 10 mg twice daily (0.4/100PY). In the post-marketing period seizures have been reported. The majority of seizures occurred at the recommended dose and in patients without a history of seizures, and generally within days to weeks of starting therapy.\n\n\n\n AMPYRA has not been evaluated in patients with a history of seizures or with evidence of epileptiform activity on an EEG, as these patients were excluded from clinical trials. The risk of seizures in patients with epileptiform activity on an EEG is unknown, and could be substantially higher than that observed in AMPYRA clinical studies. AMPYRA should be discontinued and not restarted in patients who experience a seizure while on treatment. AMPYRA is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Renal Impairment\n\n\n\n  AMPYRA is eliminated through the kidneys primarily as unchanged drug [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)  ].  \n\n\n\n Because patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCl <=50mL/min) would require a dose lower than 10 mg twice daily and no strength smaller than 10 mg is available, AMPYRA is contraindicated in these patients [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .\n\n\n\n In patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl 51-80 mL/min), AMPYRA plasma levels may approach those seen at a dose of 15 mg twice daily, a dose that may be associated with an increased risk of seizures [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.3 Concurrent Treatment with Other Forms of 4-Aminopyridine\n\n\n\n  AMPYRA should not be taken with other forms of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, fampridine) since the active ingredient is the same. Patients should discontinue use of any product containing 4-aminopyridine prior to initiating treatment with AMPYRA in order to reduce the potential for dose-related adverse reactions.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Anaphylaxis\n\n\n\n  AMPYRA can cause anaphylaxis and severe allergic reactions. Signs and symptoms have included respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and or tongue. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and instructed to discontinue AMPYRA and seek immediate medical care should these signs and symptoms occur (  17.3  ).\n\n\n\n    5.5 Urinary Tract Infections\n\n\n\n  Urinary tract infections (UTIs) were reported more frequently as adverse reactions in controlled studies in patients receiving AMPYRA 10 mg twice daily (12%) as compared to placebo (8%). UTIs in AMPYRA-treated patients should be evaluated and treated as clinically indicated.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  QT prolongation can occur with SIRTURO. Monitor ECGs and discontinue SIRTURO if significant ventricular arrhythmia or QTcF interval > 500 ms develops. (  5.2  ) \n *  Hepatotoxicity may occur with use of SIRTURO. Monitor liver-related laboratory tests. Discontinue if evidence of liver injury. (  5.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Increased Mortality\n\n\n\n  An increased risk of death was seen in the SIRTURO treatment group (9/79, 11.4%) compared to the placebo treatment group (2/81, 2.5%) in one placebo-controlled trial (based on the 120-week visit window). One death occurred during the 24 weeks of administration of SIRTURO. The imbalance in deaths is unexplained. No discernible pattern between death and sputum culture conversion, relapse, sensitivity to other drugs used to treat tuberculosis, HIV status, or severity of disease could be observed. Only use SIRTURO when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be provided [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 QT Prolongation\n\n\n\n  SIRTURO prolongs the QT interval. Obtain an ECG before initiation of treatment, and at least 2, 12, and 24 weeks after starting treatment with SIRTURO. Obtain serum potassium, calcium, and magnesium at baseline and correct if abnormal. Monitor electrolytes if QT prolongation is detected [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    and   Drug Interactions (7.4)  ]  . SIRTURO has not been studied in patients with ventricular arrhythmias or recent myocardial infarction.\n\n\n\n The following may increase the risk for QT prolongation when patients are receiving SIRTURO:\n\n\n\n *  use with other QT prolonging drugs including fluoroquinolones and macrolide antibacterial drugs and the antimycobacterial drug, clofazimine \n *  a history of Torsade de Pointes \n *  a history of congenital long QT syndrome \n *  a history of or ongoing hypothyroidism \n *  a history of or ongoing bradyarrhythmias \n *  a history of uncompensated heart failure \n *  serum calcium, magnesium, or potassium levels below the lower limits of normal \n    If necessary, bedaquiline treatment initiation could be considered in these patients after a favorable benefit risk assessment and with frequent ECG monitoring.\n \n\n Discontinue SIRTURO and all other QT prolonging drugs if the patient develops:\n\n\n\n *  Clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia \n *  A QTcF interval of greater than 500 ms (confirmed by repeat ECG) \n    If syncope occurs, obtain an ECG to detect QT prolongation.\n \n\n    5.3 Hepatotoxicity\n\n\n\n  More hepatic-related adverse reactions were reported with the use of SIRTURO plus other drugs used to treat tuberculosis compared to other drugs used to treat tuberculosis without the addition of SIRTURO. Alcohol and other hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided while on SIRTURO, especially in patients with impaired hepatic function.\n\n\n\n Monitor symptoms (such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver tenderness and hepatomegaly) and laboratory tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) at baseline, monthly while on treatment, and as needed. Test for viral hepatitis and discontinue other hepatotoxic medications if evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction occurs. Discontinue SIRTURO if:\n\n\n\n *  aminotransferase elevations are accompanied by total bilirubin elevation greater than two times the upper limit of normal \n *  aminotransferase elevations are greater than eight times the upper limit of normal \n *  aminotransferase elevations are greater than five times the upper limit of normal and persist beyond two weeks \n       5.4 Drug Interactions\n \n\n   CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors  \n\n\n\n Bedaquiline is metabolized by CYP3A4 and its systemic exposure and therapeutic effect may therefore be reduced during co-administration with inducers of CYP3A4. Avoid co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifamycins (i.e., rifampin, rifapentine and rifabutin), or moderate CYP3A4 inducers, such as efavirenz, during treatment with SIRTURO [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Co-administration of SIRTURO with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the systemic exposure to bedaquiline, which could potentially increase the risk of adverse reactions. Therefore, avoid the use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors for more than 14 consecutive days while on SIRTURO, unless the benefit of treatment with the drug combination outweighs the risk [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  . Appropriate clinical monitoring for SIRTURO-related adverse reactions is recommended.\n",

Have anaphylactic and hypersensitivity treatment measures available prior to AdreView administration. (  5.1  ) \n *  Drugs which block norepinephrine uptake or deplete norepinephrine stores may decrease AdreView uptake. When medically feasible, stop these drugs before AdreView administration and monitor patients for withdrawal signs and symptoms. (  5.2  ) \n *  AdreView contains benzyl alcohol (10.3 mg/mL) which may cause serious reactions in premature or low birth-weight infants. (  5.3  ) \n *  Patients with severe renal impairment may have increased radiation exposure and decreased quality of AdreView images. (  5.4  ) \n *  Failure to block thyroid iodine uptake may result in iodine 123 accumulation in the thyroid. (  5.6  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following AdreView administration. Prior to administration, question the patient for a history of prior reactions to iodine, an iodine-containing contrast agent or other products containing iodine. If the patient is known or strongly suspected to have hypersensitivity to iodine, an iodine-containing contrast agent or other products containing iodine, the decision to administer AdreView should be based upon an assessment of the expected benefits compared to the potential hypersensitivity risks. Have anaphylactic and hypersensitivity treatment measures available prior to AdreView administration [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.2 Imaging Errors due to Concomitant Medications and Risks Associated with Withdrawal of Medications\n\n\n\n   Many medications have the potential to interfere with AdreView imaging and review of the patient's medications is required prior to AdreView dosing due to the risk for unreliable imaging results. If the AdreView imaging information is essential for clinical care, consider the withdrawal of the following categories of medications if the withdrawal can be accomplished safely: antihypertensives that deplete norepinephrine stores or inhibit reuptake (e.g., reserpine, labetalol), antidepressants that inhibit norepinephrine transporter function (e.g., amitriptyline and derivatives, imipramine and derivatives, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), and sympathomimetic amines (e.g., phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine and ephedrine). The period of time necessary to discontinue any specific medication prior to AdreView dosing has not been established [ see  Drug Interactions (7)    ].  \n\n\n\n     Pheochromocytoma and Neuroblastoma    \n\n\n\n  Drugs which interfere with norepinephrine uptake in neuroendocrine tumors may lead to false negative imaging results. When medically feasible, stop these drugs before AdreView administration and monitor patients for the occurrence of clinically significant withdrawal symptoms, especially patients with elevated levels of circulating catecholamines and their metabolites.  \n\n\n\n     Congestive Heart Failure    \n\n\n\n  Many commonly used cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neuropsychiatric medications interfere with AdreView imaging (see above). AdreView imaging should not be performed if discontinuation of these medications would involve risks which outweigh the value of AdreView imaging. In clinical trials, patients were not eligible for AdreView imaging if they were receiving medications in the above categories and the risks for medication withdrawal were unacceptable or if they were not clinically stable (e.g., experiencing continuing chest pain, hemodynamic instability, or clinically significant arrhythmia).  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Risks for Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity in Infants\n\n\n\n  AdreView contains benzyl alcohol at a concentration of 10.3 mg/mL. Benzyl alcohol has been associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants and infants of low birth weight. Exposure to excessive amounts of benzyl alcohol has been associated with toxicity (hypotension, metabolic acidosis), particularly in neonates, and an increased incidence of kernicterus, particularly in small preterm infants. There have been rare reports of deaths, primarily in preterm infants, associated with exposure to excessive amounts of benzyl alcohol [ see  Description (11)    ].\n\n\n\n Observe infants for signs or symptoms of benzyl alcohol toxicity following AdreView administration. AdreView safety and effectiveness have not been established in neonates (pediatric patients below the age of 1 month).\n\n\n\n    5.4 Increased Radiation Exposure in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment\n\n\n\n  AdreView is cleared by glomerular filtration and is not dialyzable. The radiation dose to patients with severe renal impairment may be increased due to the delayed elimination of the drug. Delayed AdreView clearance may also reduce the target to background ratios and decrease the quality of scintigraphic images. These risks importantly may limit the role of AdreView in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with severe renal impairment. AdreView safety and efficacy have not been established in these patients [ see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.5 Imaging Errors due to Conditions that Affect the Sympathetic Nervous System\n\n\n\n   Individuals with conditions that affect the sympathetic nervous system, e.g., Parkinsonian syndromes such as Parkinson's disease or multiple system atrophy, may show decreased cardiac uptake of AdreView independent of heart disease.  \n\n\n\n    5.6 Thyroid Accumulation\n\n\n\n   Failure to block thyroid uptake of iodine 123 may result in an increased long term risk for thyroid neoplasia [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].  \n\n\n\n    5.7 Hypertension\n\n\n\n  Assess the patient's pulse and blood pressure before and intermittently for 30 minutes after AdreView administration. AdreView may increase release of norepinephrine from chromaffin granules and produce a transient episode of hypertension, although this was not observed in the clinical studies. Prior to AdreView administration, ensure emergency cardiac and anti-hypertensive treatments are readily available.\n",

        "section_text": "     5     WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Do not initiate in acutely deteriorating COPD patients (  5.2  ) \n *  Do not use for relief of acute symptoms. Concomitant short-acting beta2-agonists can be used as needed for acute relief (  5.2  ) \n *  Do not exceed the recommended dose. Excessive use or use in conjunction with other medications containing LABA can result in clinically significant cardiovascular effects and may be fatal (  5.3  ) \n *  Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur. Discontinue immediately. (  5.4  ) \n *  Life-threatening paradoxical bronchospasm can occur. Discontinue immediately. (  5.5  ) \n *  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular or convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis or sensitivity to sympathomimetic drugs. (  5.6  ,  5.7  )  \n    \n \n\n   5.1     Asthma-Related Death [See Boxed Warning]  \n\n\n\n    *   Data from a large placebo-controlled study in asthma patients showed that long-acting beta  2  -adrenergic agonists may increase the risk of asthma-related death. Data are not available to determine whether the rate of death in patients with COPD is increased by long-acting beta  2  -adrenergic agonists.  \n *   A 28-week, placebo-controlled US study comparing the safety of another long-acting beta  2  -adrenergic agonist (  salmeterol  ) with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in patients treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in patients treated with placebo; RR 4.37, 95% CI 1.25, 15.34). The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of the long-acting beta  2  -adrenergic agonists, including  ARCAPTA NEOHALER  . No study adequate to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased in patients treated with  ARCAPTA NEOHALER  has been conducted. The safety and efficacy of  ARCAPTA NEOHALER  in patients with asthma have not been established.  ARCAPTA NEOHALER  is not indicated for the treatment of asthma. [  see Contraindications (4  )].  \n *   Serious asthma-related events, including death, were reported in clinical studies with ARCAPTA NEOHALER. The sizes of these studies were not adequate to precisely quantify the differences in serious asthma exacerbation rates between treatment groups  .  [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )]  .  \n       5.2     Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes\n \n\n  ARCAPTA NEOHALER should not be initiated in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD, which may be a life-threatening condition. ARCAPTA NEOHALER has not been studied in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD. The use of ARCAPTA NEOHALER in this setting is inappropriate. \n\n\n\n ARCAPTA NEOHALER should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e. as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. ARCAPTA NEOHALER has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist.\n\n\n\n When beginning ARCAPTA NEOHALER, patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., four times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing ARCAPTA NEOHALER, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta2- agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. Increasing inhaled beta2-agonist use is a signal of deteriorating disease for which prompt medical attention is indicated.\n\n\n\n COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If ARCAPTA NEOHALER no longer controls the symptoms of bronchoconstriction, or the patient's inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist becomes less effective or the patient needs more inhalation of short-acting beta2-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting, a re-evaluation of the patient and the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. Increasing the daily dosage of ARCAPTA NEOHALER beyond the recommended dose is not appropriate in this situation. \n\n\n\n    5.3     Excessive Use of ARCAPTA NEOHALER and Use with Other Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists\n\n\n\n  As with other inhaled beta2-adrenergic drugs, ARCAPTA NEOHALER should not be used more often, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medications containing long-acting beta2-agonists, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.  \n\n\n\n    5.4     Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n   Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of ARCAPTA NEOHALER. If signs suggesting allergic reactions (in particular, difficulties in breathing or swallowing, swelling of tongue, lips and face, urticaria, skin rash) occur, ARCAPTA NEOHALER should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted.  \n\n\n\n    5.5     Paradoxical Bronchospasm\n\n\n\n  As with other inhaled beta2-agonists, ARCAPTA NEOHALER may produce paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, ARCAPTA NEOHALER should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted.\n\n\n\n    5.6     Cardiovascular Effects\n\n\n\n  ARCAPTA NEOHALER, like other beta2-agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, or symptoms. If such effects occur, ARCAPTA NEOHALER may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce ECG changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression, although the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, ARCAPTA NEOHALER, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.\n\n\n\n    5.7     Coexisting Conditions\n\n\n\n  ARCAPTA NEOHALER, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis, and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta2-agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate pre-existing diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. \n\n\n\n    5.8     Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia\n\n\n\n  Beta2-agonist medications may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Inhalation of high doses of beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce increases in plasma glucose.\n\n\n\n Clinically notable decreases in serum potassium or changes in blood glucose were infrequent during clinical studies with long-term administration of ARCAPTA NEOHALER with the rates similar to those for placebo controls. ARCAPTA NEOHALER has not been investigated in patients whose diabetes mellitus is not well controlled.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n  EXCERPT:   Severe, potentially life threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme. Immediately discontinue treatment if severe hypersensitivity, severe rash or rash with systemic symptoms or liver transaminase elevations develops and monitor clinical status, including liver transaminases closely. (  5.1  )\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n   5.1 Severe Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Severe, potentially life-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported. These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme. Hypersensitivity reactions including Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have also been reported and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. In Phase 3 clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 1.3% of subjects receiving INTELENCE  (r)  compared to 0.2% of placebo subjects. A total of 2.2% of HIV-1-infected subjects receiving INTELENCE  (r)  discontinued from Phase 3 trials due to rash [ see  Adverse Reactions (6)    ]. Rash occurred most commonly during the first 6 weeks of therapy. The incidence of rash was higher in females [ see  Adverse Reactions (6)    ]\n\n\n\n Discontinue INTELENCE  (r)  immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver transaminases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping INTELENCE  (r)  treatment after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Fat Redistribution\n\n\n\n  Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including INTELENCE  (r)  . During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia (PCP) or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.\n\n\n\n Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n",

Observe for hypersensitivity signs and symptoms following Vizamyl administration. Have resuscitation equipment and trained personnel available at time of Vizamyl administration (  5.1  ) \n *  Image interpretation errors (especially false positives) have been observed (  5.2  ) \n *  Radiation risk: Vizamyl, similar to all radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a patient's long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Ensure safe handling to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure (  2.1  ,  5.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Hypersensitivity reactions such as flushing and dyspnea have been observed within minutes following Vizamyl administration. These reactions may occur in patients with no history of prior exposure to Vizamyl.\n\n\n\n Before administering Vizamyl, ask patients about prior reactions to drugs, especially those containing polysorbate 80.\n\n\n\n Have resuscitation equipment and trained personnel immediately available at the time of Vizamyl administration [ see  Contraindications (4)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.2 Risk for Image Misinterpretation and Other Errors\n\n\n\n  Errors may occur while using Vizamyl PET images to estimate brain neuritic plaque density [ see  Clinical Studies (14)    ].\n\n\n\n Image interpretation is performed independently of the patient's clinical information. The use of clinical information in the interpretation of Vizamyl images has not been evaluated and may lead to errors. Extensive brain atrophy may limit the ability to distinguish grey and white matter on a Vizamyl scan [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)    ]. Motion artifacts may distort the image [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)    ].\n\n\n\n Vizamyl scan results are indicative of the brain neuritic amyloid plaque content only at the time of image acquisition and a negative scan result does not preclude the development of brain amyloid in the future.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Radiation Risk\n\n\n\n  Vizamyl, similar to other radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)    ] .  \n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Urinary retention: Patients should be carefully monitored for urologic symptoms. (  5.2  ) \n *    POTIGA can cause skin discoloration. If a patient develops skin discoloration, serious consideration should be given to an alternative treatment. (  5.3  ) \n *    Neuropsychiatric symptoms: Monitor for confusional state, psychotic symptoms, and hallucinations. (  5.4  ) \n *    Monitor for dizziness and somnolence. (  5.5  ) \n *    QT prolongation: QT interval should be monitored in patients taking concomitant medications known to increase the QT interval or with certain heart conditions. (  5.6  ) \n *    Monitor for suicidal thoughts or behaviors. (  5.7  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Retinal Abnormalities and Potential Vision Loss\n\n\n\n  POTIGA can cause abnormalities of the retina. The abnormalities seen in patients treated with POTIGA have funduscopic features similar to those seen in retinal pigment dystrophies that are known to result in damage to photoreceptors and vision loss.\n\n\n\n The retinal abnormalities observed with POTIGA have been reported in patients who were originally enrolled in clinical trials with POTIGA and who have generally taken the drug for a long period of time in 2 ongoing extension trials. Approximately one third of the patients who had eye examinations performed after approximately 4 years of treatment were found to have retinal pigmentary abnormalities. However, an earlier onset cannot be ruled out, and it is possible that retinal abnormalities were present earlier in the course of exposure to POTIGA. POTIGA causes skin, scleral, nail, and mucous membrane discoloration and it is not clear whether this discoloration is related to retinal abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]  . Approximately 15% of patients with retinal pigmentary abnormalities had no such discoloration.\n\n\n\n Funduscopic abnormalities have most commonly been described as perivascular pigmentation (bone spicule pattern) in the retinal periphery and/or as areas of focal retinal pigment epithelium clumping. Although some of the patients with retinal abnormalities have been found to have abnormal visual acuity, it is not possible to assess whether POTIGA caused their decreased visual acuity, as baseline assessments are not available for these patients. Two patients with retinal abnormalities have had more extensive diagnostic retinal evaluations. The results of these evaluations were consistent with a retinal dystrophy, including abnormalities in the electroretinogram and electrooculogram of both patients, with abnormal fluorescein angiography and diminished sensitivity on visual field testing in one patient.\n\n\n\n The rate of progression of retinal abnormalities and the reversibility after drug discontinuation are unknown.\n\n\n\n Because of the observed ophthalmologic adverse reactions, POTIGA should only be used in patients who have responded inadequately to several alternative treatments and for whom the benefits outweigh the risk of retinal abnormalities and potential vision loss. Patients who fail to show substantial clinical benefit after adequate titration should be discontinued from POTIGA.\n\n\n\n Patients should have baseline ophthalmologic testing by an ophthalmic professional and follow-up testing every 6 months. The best method of detection of these abnormalities and the optimal frequency of periodic ophthalmologic monitoring are unknown. Patients who cannot be monitored should usually not be treated with POTIGA. The ophthalmologic monitoring program should include visual acuity testing and dilated fundus photography. Additional testing may include fluorescein angiograms (FA), optical coherence tomography (OCT), perimetry, and electroretinograms (ERG). If retinal pigmentary abnormalities or vision changes are detected, POTIGA should be discontinued unless no other suitable treatment options are available and the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk of vision loss.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Urinary Retention\n\n\n\n  POTIGA caused urinary retention in clinical trials. Urinary retention was generally reported within the first 6 months of treatment, but was also observed later. Urinary retention was reported as an adverse event in 29 of 1,365 (approximately 2%) patients treated with POTIGA in the open-label and placebo-controlled epilepsy database [see Clinical Studies (14)]  . Of these 29 patients, 5 (17%) required catheterization, with post-voiding residuals of up to 1,500 mL. POTIGA was discontinued in 3 of the 5 patients who required catheterization, and all were able to void spontaneously; however, 1 of the 3 patients continued intermittent self-catheterization. Two patients continued treatment with POTIGA and were able to void spontaneously after catheter removal. Hydronephrosis occurred in 2 patients, one of whom had associated renal function impairment that resolved upon discontinuation of POTIGA. Hydronephrosis was not reported in placebo patients.\n\n\n\n In the placebo-controlled epilepsy trials, \"urinary retention,\" \"urinary hesitation,\" and \"dysuria\" were reported in 0.9%, 2.2%, and 2.3% of patients on POTIGA, respectively, and in 0.5%, 0.9%, and 0.7% of patients on placebo, respectively.\n\n\n\n Because of the increased risk of urinary retention on POTIGA, urologic symptoms should be carefully monitored. Closer monitoring is recommended for patients who have other risk factors for urinary retention (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH]), patients who are unable to communicate clinical symptoms (e.g., cognitively impaired patients), or patients who use concomitant medications that may affect voiding (e.g., anticholinergics). In these patients, a comprehensive evaluation of urologic symptoms prior to and during treatment with POTIGA may be appropriate.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Skin Discoloration\n\n\n\n  POTIGA can cause skin discoloration. The skin discoloration is generally described as blue, but has also been described as grey-blue or brown. It is predominantly on or around the lips or in the nail beds of the fingers or toes, but more widespread involvement of the face and legs has also been reported. Discoloration of the palate, sclera, and conjunctiva has also been reported.\n\n\n\n Approximately 10% of patients in long-term clinical trials developed skin discoloration, generally after 2 or more years of treatment and at higher doses (900 mg or greater) of POTIGA. Among patients in whom the status of both skin, nail, lip, or mucous membrane discoloration and retinal pigmentary abnormalities are reported, approximately a quarter of those with skin, nail, lip, or mucous membrane discoloration had concurrent retinal pigmentary abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  .\n\n\n\n Information on the consequences, reversibility, time to onset, and pathophysiology of the skin abnormalities remains incomplete. The possibility of more extensive systemic involvement has not been excluded. If a patient develops skin discoloration, serious consideration should be given to changing to an alternate medication.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Neuropsychiatric Symptoms\n\n\n\n  Confusional state, psychotic symptoms, and hallucinations were reported more frequently as adverse reactions in patients treated with POTIGA than in those treated with placebo in placebo-controlled epilepsy trials (see Table 2). Discontinuations resulting from these reactions were more common in the drug-treated group (see Table 2). These effects were dose-related and generally appeared within the first 8 weeks of treatment. Half of the patients in the controlled trials who discontinued POTIGA due to hallucinations or psychosis required hospitalization. Approximately two-thirds of patients with psychosis in controlled trials had no prior psychiatric history. The psychiatric symptoms in the vast majority of patients in both controlled and open-label trials resolved within 7 days of discontinuation of POTIGA. Rapid titration at greater than the recommended doses appeared to increase the risk of psychosis and hallucinations.\n\n\n\n  Table 2. Major Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Placebo-Controlled Epilepsy Trials  \n\n\n\n\n  Adverse Reaction      Number (%) with Adverse Reaction    Number (%) Discontinuing    \n  POTIGA  (n = 813)     Placebo  (n = 427)    POTIGA  (n = 813)    Placebo  (n = 427)    \n  Confusional state     75 (9%)              11 (3%)              32 (4%)          4 (<1%)         \n  Psychosis             9 (1%)               0                    6 (<1%)          0               \n  Hallucinationsa       14 (2%)              2 (<1%)              6 (<1%)          0               \n             a  Hallucinations includes visual, auditory, and mixed hallucinations.\n \n\n    5.5 Dizziness and Somnolence\n\n\n\n  POTIGA causes dose-related increases in dizziness and somnolence [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  . In placebo-controlled trials in patients with epilepsy, dizziness was reported in 23% of patients treated with POTIGA and 9% of patients treated with placebo. Somnolence was reported in 22% of patients treated with POTIGA and 12% of patients treated with placebo. In these trials 6% of patients on POTIGA and 1.2% on placebo discontinued treatment because of dizziness; 3% of patients on POTIGA and <1.0% on placebo discontinued because of somnolence.\n\n\n\n Most of these adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity and occurred during the titration phase. For those patients continued on POTIGA, dizziness and somnolence appeared to diminish with continued use.\n\n\n\n    5.6 QT Interval Effect\n\n\n\n  A study of cardiac conduction showed that POTIGA produced a mean 7.7-msec QT prolongation in healthy volunteers titrated to 400 mg 3 times daily. The QT-prolonging effect occurred within 3 hours. The QT interval should be monitored when POTIGA is prescribed with medicines known to increase QT interval and in patients with known prolonged QT interval, congestive heart failure, ventricular hypertrophy, hypokalemia, or hypomagnesemia [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.7 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation\n\n\n\n  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including POTIGA, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.\n\n\n\n Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive-therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted relative risk 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared with patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43% compared with 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately 1 case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\n\n\n\n The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.\n\n\n\n The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanism of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.\n\n\n\n Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.\n\n\n\n  Table 3. Risk of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis  \n\n\n\n\n  Indication    Placebo Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients    Drug Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients    Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients    Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients    \n  Epilepsy     1.0                3.4                3.5                              2.4                        \n  Psychiatric    5.7                8.5                1.5                              2.9                        \n  Other        1.0                1.8                1.9                              0.9                        \n  Total        2.4                4.3                1.8                              1.9                        \n           The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials in patients with epilepsy than in clinical trials in patients with psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for epilepsy and psychiatric indications.\n \n\n Anyone considering prescribing POTIGA or any other AED must balance this risk with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.\n\n\n\n Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression; any unusual changes in mood or behavior; or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Withdrawal Seizures\n\n\n\n  As with all AEDs, when POTIGA is discontinued, it should be withdrawn gradually when possible to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]  . The dosage of POTIGA should be reduced over a period of at least 3 weeks, unless safety concerns require abrupt withdrawal.\n",

Prescribe only for recommended patient populations. (  5.1  ) \n *    Do not initiate in acutely deteriorating COPD or asthma. Do not use to treat acute symptoms. (  5.2  ) \n *    Do not use in combination with an additional medicine containing a LABA because of risk of overdose. (  5.3  ) \n *     Candida albicans infection of the mouth and pharynx may occur. Monitor patients periodically. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing after inhalation to help reduce the risk. (  5.4  ) \n *    Increased risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonia. (  5.5  ) \n *    Potential worsening of infections (e.g., existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; ocular herpes simplex). Use with caution in patients with these infections. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles can occur in susceptible patients. (  5.6  ) \n *    Risk of impaired adrenal function when transferring from systemic corticosteroids. Taper patients slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to BREO ELLIPTA. (  5.7  ) \n *    Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may occur with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue BREO ELLIPTA slowly. (  5.8  ) \n *    If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue BREO ELLIPTA and institute alternative therapy. (  5.10  ) \n *    Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders because of beta-adrenergic stimulation. (  5.12  ) \n *    Assess for decrease in bone mineral density initially and periodically thereafter. (  5.13  ) \n *    Close monitoring for glaucoma and cataracts is warranted. (  5.14  ) \n *    Use with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus, and ketoacidosis. (  5.15  ) \n *    Be alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. (  5.16  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Asthma-Related Death\n\n\n\n   LABA, such as vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in BREO ELLIPTA, increase the risk of asthma-related death. Currently available data are inadequate to determine whether concurrent use of inhaled corticosteroids or other long-term asthma control drugs mitigates the increased risk of asthma-related death from LABA. Available data from controlled clinical trials suggest that LABA increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. Therefore, when treating patients with asthma, physicians should only prescribe BREO ELLIPTA for patients not adequately controlled on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid, or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a LABA. Once asthma control is achieved and maintained, assess the patient at regular intervals and step down therapy (e.g., discontinue BREO ELLIPTA) if possible without loss of asthma control and maintain the patient on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid. Do not use BREO ELLIPTA for patients whose asthma is adequately controlled on low- or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids.  \n\n\n\n A 28-week, placebo-controlled, US trial that compared the safety of another LABA (salmeterol) with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in subjects treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in subjects treated with placebo; relative risk: 4.37 [95% CI: 1.25, 15.34]). The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of LABA, including vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in BREO ELLIPTA. No trial adequate to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased in subjects treated with BREO ELLIPTA has been conducted.\n\n\n\n Data are not available to determine whether the rate of death in patients with COPD is increased by LABA.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes\n\n\n\n  BREO ELLIPTA should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of COPD or asthma. BREO ELLIPTA has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating COPD or asthma. The initiation of BREO ELLIPTA in this setting is not appropriate.\n\n\n\n COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 no longer controls symptoms of bronchoconstriction; the patient's inhaled, short-acting, beta2-agonist becomes less effective; or the patient needs more short-acting beta2-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting a reevaluation of the patient and the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. For COPD, increasing the daily dose of BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 is not appropriate in this situation.\n\n\n\n Increasing use of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma. In this situation, the patient requires immediate reevaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for replacing the current strength of BREO ELLIPTA with a higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, or initiating systemic corticosteroids. Patients should not use more than 1 inhalation once daily of BREO ELLIPTA.\n\n\n\n BREO ELLIPTA should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. BREO ELLIPTA has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist.\n\n\n\n When beginning treatment with BREO ELLIPTA, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and to use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing BREO ELLIPTA, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Excessive Use of BREO ELLIPTA and Use with Other Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists\n\n\n\n  BREO ELLIPTA should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medicines containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using BREO ELLIPTA should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Local Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids\n\n\n\n  In clinical trials, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans  has occurred in subjects treated with BREO ELLIPTA. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while treatment with BREO ELLIPTA continues, but at times therapy with BREO ELLIPTA may need to be interrupted. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing following inhalation to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Pneumonia\n\n\n\n  An increase in the incidence of pneumonia has been observed in subjects with COPD receiving BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 in clinical trials. There was also an increased incidence of pneumonias resulting in hospitalization. In some incidences these pneumonia events were fatal. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of such infections overlap with the symptoms of COPD exacerbations.\n\n\n\n In replicate 12-month trials in 3,255 subjects with COPD who had experienced a COPD exacerbation in the previous year, there was a higher incidence of pneumonia reported in subjects receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50 mcg/25 mcg: 6% (48 of 820 subjects); BREO ELLIPTA 100/25: 6% (51 of 806 subjects); or BREO ELLIPTA 200/25: 7% (55 of 811 subjects) than in subjects receiving vilanterol 25 mcg: 3% (27 of 818 subjects). There was no fatal pneumonia in subjects receiving vilanterol or fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50 mcg/25 mcg. There was fatal pneumonia in 1 subject receiving BREO ELLIPTA 100/25 and in 7 subjects receiving BREO ELLIPTA 200/25 (less than 1% for each treatment group).\n\n\n\n    5.6 Immunosuppression\n\n\n\n  Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.\n\n\n\n Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy\n\n\n\n  Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.\n\n\n\n Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although BREO ELLIPTA may control COPD or asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.\n\n\n\n During periods of stress, a severe COPD exacerbation, or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress, a severe COPD exacerbation, or a severe asthma attack.\n\n\n\n Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to BREO ELLIPTA. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with BREO ELLIPTA. Lung function (FEV1or peak expiratory flow), beta-agonist use, and COPD or asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.\n\n\n\n Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to BREO ELLIPTA may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions).\n\n\n\n During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression\n\n\n\n  Inhaled fluticasone furoate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active. Effects of fluticasone furoate on the HPA axis are not observed with the therapeutic doses of BREO ELLIPTA. However, exceeding the recommended dosage or coadministration with a strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor may result in HPA dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Drug Interactions (7.1)]  .\n\n\n\n Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids in sensitive patients, patients treated with BREO ELLIPTA should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.\n\n\n\n It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients who are sensitive to these effects. If such effects occur, BREO ELLIPTA should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids, and other treatments for management of COPD or asthma symptoms should be considered.\n\n\n\n    5.9 Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors\n\n\n\n  Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of BREO ELLIPTA with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole) because increased systemic corticosteroid and increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  \n\n\n\n    5.10 Paradoxical Bronchospasm\n\n\n\n  As with other inhaled medicines, BREO ELLIPTA can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with BREO ELLIPTA, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; BREO ELLIPTA should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted.\n\n\n\n    5.11 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis\n\n\n\n  Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria may occur after administration of BREO ELLIPTA. Discontinue BREO ELLIPTA if such reactions occur. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of other powder medications containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use BREO ELLIPTA [see Contraindications (4)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.12 Cardiovascular Effects\n\n\n\n  Vilanterol, like other beta2-agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and also cardiac arrhythmias, such as supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles. If such effects occur, BREO ELLIPTA may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiographic changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression, although the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.\n\n\n\n In healthy subjects, large doses of inhaled fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (4 times the recommended dose of vilanterol, representing a 12- or 10-fold higher systemic exposure than seen in subjects with COPD or asthma, respectively) have been associated with clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, BREO ELLIPTA, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.\n\n\n\n    5.13 Reduction in Bone Mineral Density\n\n\n\n  Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care. Since patients with COPD often have multiple risk factors for reduced BMD, assessment of BMD is recommended prior to initiating BREO ELLIPTA and periodically thereafter. If significant reductions in BMD are seen and BREO ELLIPTA is still considered medically important for that patient's COPD therapy, use of medicine to treat or prevent osteoporosis should be strongly considered.\n\n\n\n    5.14 Glaucoma and Cataracts\n\n\n\n  Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients with COPD or asthma following the long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts.\n\n\n\n    5.15 Coexisting Conditions\n\n\n\n  BREO ELLIPTA, like all medicines containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta2-adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.\n\n\n\n    5.16 Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia\n\n\n\n  Beta-adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Beta-agonist medications may produce transient hyperglycemia in some patients. In clinical trials evaluating BREO ELLIPTA in subjects with COPD or asthma, there was no evidence of a treatment effect on serum glucose or potassium.\n\n\n\n    5.17 Effect on Growth\n\n\n\n  Orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to children and adolescents.

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n     EXCERPT:    *  Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis has occurred in patients with impaired elimination of GBCAs. Higher than recommended dosing or repeat dosing appear to increase the risk. (  5.1  ) \n *  Hypersensitivity: Anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions with cardiovascular, respiratory or cutaneous manifestations, ranging from mild to severe, including death, have uncommonly occurred. Monitor patients closely for need of emergency cardiorespiratory support. (  5.2  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis\n\n\n\n  Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m  2  ) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. The risk appears lower for patients with chronic, moderate kidney disease (GFR 30 - 59 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ) and little, if any, for patients with chronic, mild kidney disease (GFR 60 - 89 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ). NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs. Report any diagnosis of NSF following DOTAREM administration to Guerbet LLC (1-877-729-6679) or FDA (1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch).\n\n\n\n Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid (over hours to days) and usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly in the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced kidney toxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not reliably assess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (e.g., age > 60 years, diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension), estimate the GFR through laboratory testing.\n\n\n\n Among the factors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA and the degree of renal impairment at the time of exposure. Record the specific GBCA and the dose administered to a patient. For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended DOTAREM dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug prior to re-administration. For patients receiving hemodialysis, physicians may consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration of a GBCA in order to enhance the contrast agent's elimination. The usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown [see Dosage and Administration (  2  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with DOTAREM, involving cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or cutaneous manifestations. Some patients experienced circulatory collapse and died. In most cases, initial symptoms occurred within minutes of DOTAREM administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment [see Adverse Reactions  (6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n *  Before DOTAREM administration, assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media, bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to DOTAREM. \n *  Administer DOTAREM only in situations where trained personnel and therapies are promptly available for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, including personnel trained in resuscitation. \n *  During and following DOTAREM administration, observe patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. \n       5.3 Acute Kidney Injury\n \n\n  In patients with chronically reduced renal function, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent; administer the lowest dose necessary for adequate imaging. Screen all patients for renal impairment by obtaining a history and/or laboratory tests. Consider follow-up renal function assessments for patients with a history of renal dysfunction.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions\n\n\n\n  Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of DOTAREM. Extravasation into tissues during DOTAREM administration may result in tissue irritation [see Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.2  )]  .\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Acute pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue NESINA. (5.1) \n *    Hypersensitivity: There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with NESINA such as anaphylaxis, angioedema and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. In such cases, promptly discontinue NESINA, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes. (5.2) \n *    Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt NESINA and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart NESINA if liver injury is confirmed and no alternative etiology can be found. (5.3) \n *    Hypoglycemia: When an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin is used in combination with NESINA, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. (5.4) \n *    Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. (5.5) \n *    Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with NESINA or any other antidiabetic drug. (5.6) \n    \n   5.1 Pancreatitis\n\n  There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking NESINA. After initiation of NESINA, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, NESINA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using NESINA.\n\n\n\n   5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n  There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with NESINA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema and severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue NESINA, assess for other potential causes for the event and institute alternative treatment for diabetes  [seeAdverse Reactions (6.2)]  . Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with NESINA.\n\n\n\n   5.3 Hepatic Effects\n\n  There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking NESINA, although some of the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause  [seeAdverse Reactions (6.2)]  . In randomized controlled studies, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed: 1.3% in alogliptin-treated patients and 1.5% in all comparator-treated patients.\n\n\n\n Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease, which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel and assessing the patient before initiating NESINA therapy is recommended. In patients with abnormal liver tests, NESINA should be initiated with caution.\n\n\n\n Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have clinically significant liver enzyme elevations and if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, NESINA should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. NESINA should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.\n\n\n\n   5.4 Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia\n\n  Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, are known to cause hypoglycemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with NESINA.\n\n\n\n     5.5 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia  \n\n    There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate.  \n\n\n\n   5.6 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\n  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with NESINA or any other antidiabetic drug.\n",

Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. (5.1) \n *  Increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of an intravitreal injection. (5.2) \n *  There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. (5.3) \n    \n   5.1 Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments\n\n  Intravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [  seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)  ]. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately [  seeDosage and Administration (2.7)andPatient Counseling Information (17)  ].\n\n\n\n   5.2 Increase in Intraocular Pressure\n\n  Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA [  seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)  ]. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately [  seeDosage and Administration (2.7)  ].\n\n\n\n   5.3 Thromboembolic Events\n\n    There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies.  \n",

(  5.1  ) \n *  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML): Withhold TECFIDERA at the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML. (  5.2  ) \n *  Lymphopenia: Obtain a CBC including lymphocyte count before initiating TECFIDERA, after 6 months, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Consider interruption of TECFIDERA if lymphocyte counts <0.5 x 10  9  /L persist for more than six months. (  5.3  ) \n    \n \n\n      5.1 Anaphylaxis and Angioedema\n\n\n\n     TECFIDERA can cause anaphylaxis and angioedema after the first dose or at any time during treatment. Signs and symptoms have included difficulty breathing, urticaria, and swelling of the throat and tongue. Patients should be instructed to discontinue TECFIDERA and seek immediate medical care should they experience signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis or angioedema.\n\n\n\n       5.2 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy\n\n\n\n     A fatal case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) occurred in a patient with MS who received TECFIDERA for 4 years while enrolled in a clinical trial. PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. During the clinical trial, the patient experienced prolonged lymphopenia (lymphocyte counts predominantly <0.5x10  9  /L for 3.5 years) while taking TECFIDERA [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  . The role of lymphopenia in this case is unknown. The patient had no other identified systemic medical conditions resulting in compromised immune system function and had not previously been treated with natalizumab, which has a known association with PML. The patient was also not taking any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medications concomitantly.\n\n\n\n At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold TECFIDERA and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Lymphopenia\n\n\n\n     TECFIDERA may decrease lymphocyte counts. In the MS placebo controlled trials, mean lymphocyte counts decreased by approximately 30% during the first year of treatment with TECFIDERA and then remained stable. Four weeks after stopping TECFIDERA, mean lymphocyte counts increased but did not return to baseline. Six percent (6%) of TECFIDERA patients and <1% of placebo patients experienced lymphocyte counts <0.5x10  9  /L (lower limit of normal 0.91x10  9  /L). The incidence of infections (60% vs 58%) and serious infections (2% vs 2%) was similar in patients treated with TECFIDERA or placebo, respectively. There was no increased incidence of serious infections observed in patients with lymphocyte counts <0.8x10  9  /L or 0.5x10  9  /L in controlled trials, although one patient in an extension study developed PML in the setting of prolonged lymphopenia (lymphocyte counts predominantly <0.5x10  9  /L for 3.5 years) [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  . In controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, 2% of patients experienced lymphocyte counts <0.5 x 10  9  /L for at least six months. In these patients, the majority of lymphocyte counts remained <0.5x10  9  /L with continued therapy. TECFIDERA has not been studied in patients with pre-existing low lymphocyte counts.\n\n\n\n    Before initiating treatment with TECFIDERA, a CBC including lymphocyte count should be obtained. A CBC including lymphocyte count should also be obtained after 6 months of treatment, every 6 to 12 months thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Consider interruption of TECFIDERA in patients with lymphocyte counts <0.5 x 10  9  /L persisting for more than six months. Given the potential for delay in lymphocyte recovery after discontinuation of TECFIDERA, consider following lymphocyte counts until lymphopenia is resolved. Withholding treatment should be considered in patients with serious infections until the infection(s) is resolved. Decisions about whether or not to restart TECFIDERA should be individualized based on clinical circumstances.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Flushing\n\n\n\n     TECFIDERA may cause flushing (e.g., warmth, redness, itching, and/or burning sensation). In clinical trials, 40% of TECFIDERA treated patients experienced flushing. Flushing symptoms generally began soon after initiating TECFIDERA and usually improved or resolved over time. In the majority of patients who experienced flushing, it was mild or moderate in severity. Three percent (3%) of patients discontinued TECFIDERA for flushing and <1% had serious flushing symptoms that were not life-threatening but led to hospitalization. Administration of TECFIDERA with food may reduce the incidence of flushing. Alternatively, administration of non-enteric coated aspirin (up to a dose of 325 mg) 30 minutes prior to TECFIDERA dosing may reduce the incidence or severity of flushing [see Dosing and Administration (  2.1  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Myelosuppression:  Delay or reduce dose. Restart treatment based on ANC and platelet count recovery. (  2.2  ) Complications of myelosuppression may lead to death. (  5.1  ) \n *    Infections:  Monitor for fever and other signs of infection and treat promptly. (  5.2  ) \n *    Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions: Severe and anaphylactic reactions have occurred; monitor clinically and discontinue TREANDA. Pre-medicate in subsequent cycles for milder reactions. (  5.3  ) \n *    Tumor Lysis Syndrome:  Acute renal failure and death; anticipate and use supportive measures. (  5.4  ) \n *    Skin Reactions:  Discontinue for severe skin reactions. Cases of SJS and TEN, some fatal, have been reported when TREANDA was administered concomitantly with allopurinol and other medications known to cause these syndromes. (  5.5  ) \n *    Other Malignancies: Pre-malignant and malignant diseases have been reported. (  5.6  ) \n *    Extravasation: Assure good venous access and monitor infusion site during and after administration. (  5.7  ) \n *    Embryo-fetal toxicity:  Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant when receiving TREANDA. (  5.8  ,  8.1  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1  Myelosuppression\n\n\n\n  TREANDA caused severe myelosuppression (Grade 3-4) in 98% of patients in the two NHL studies (see Table 4). Three patients (2%) died from myelosuppression-related adverse reactions; one each from neutropenic sepsis, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and pneumonia from an opportunistic infection (CMV).\n\n\n\n In the event of treatment-related myelosuppression, monitor leukocytes, platelets, hemoglobin (Hgb), and neutrophils frequently. In the clinical trials, blood counts were monitored every week initially. Hematologic nadirs were observed predominantly in the third week of therapy. Myelosuppression may require dose delays and/or subsequent dose reductions if recovery to the recommended values has not occurred by the first day of the next scheduled cycle. Prior to the initiation of the next cycle of therapy, the ANC should be >= 1 x 10  9  /L and the platelet count should be >= 75 x 10  9  /L. [see  Dosage and Administration  (  2.2  ) and (  2.3  )]  \n\n\n\n    5.2  Infections\n\n\n\n  Infection, including pneumonia, sepsis, septic shock, and death have occurred in adult and pediatric patients in clinical trials and in postmarketing reports. Patients with myelosuppression following treatment with TREANDA are more susceptible to infections. Advise patients with myelosuppression following TREANDA treatment to contact a physician if they have symptoms or signs of infection.\n\n\n\n    5.3  Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions\n\n\n\n  Infusion reactions to TREANDA have occurred commonly in clinical trials. Symptoms include fever, chills, pruritus and rash. In rare instances severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have occurred, particularly in the second and subsequent cycles of therapy. Monitor clinically and discontinue drug for severe reactions. Ask patients about symptoms suggestive of infusion reactions after their first cycle of therapy. Patients who experience Grade 3 or worse allergic-type reactions should not be rechallenged. Consider measures to prevent severe reactions, including antihistamines, antipyretics and corticosteroids in subsequent cycles in patients who have experienced Grade 1 or 2 infusion reactions. Discontinue TREANDA for patients with Grade 4 infusion reactions. Consider discontinuation for Grade 3 infusions reactions as clinically appropriate considering individual benefits, risks, and supportive care.\n\n\n\n    5.4  Tumor Lysis Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Tumor lysis syndrome associated with TREANDA treatment has occurred in patients in clinical trials and in postmarketing reports. The onset tends to be within the first treatment cycle of TREANDA and, without intervention, may lead to acute renal failure and death. Preventive measures include vigorous hydration and close monitoring of blood chemistry, particularly potassium and uric acid levels. Allopurinol has also been used during the beginning of TREANDA therapy. However, there may be an increased risk of severe skin toxicity when TREANDA and allopurinol are administered concomitantly [see  Warnings and Precautions  (  5.5  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5  Skin Reactions\n\n\n\n  Skin reactions have been reported with TREANDA treatment in clinical trials and postmarketing safety reports, including rash, toxic skin reactions and bullous exanthema. Some events occurred when TREANDA was given in combination with other anticancer agents.\n\n\n\n In a study of TREANDA (90 mg/m  2  ) in combination with rituximab, one case of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) occurred. TEN has been reported for rituximab (see rituximab package insert). Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and TEN, some fatal, have been reported when TREANDA was administered concomitantly with allopurinol and other medications known to cause these syndromes. The relationship to TREANDA cannot be determined.\n\n\n\n Where skin reactions occur, they may be progressive and increase in severity with further treatment. Monitor patients with skin reactions closely. If skin reactions are severe or progressive, withhold or discontinue TREANDA.\n\n\n\n    5.6  Other Malignancies\n\n\n\n  There are reports of pre-malignant and malignant diseases that have developed in patients who have been treated with TREANDA, including myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, acute myeloid leukemia and bronchial carcinoma.  The association with TREANDA therapy has not been determined.\n\n\n\n    5.7  Extravasation Injury\n\n\n\n  TREANDA extravasations have been reported in post marketing resulting in hospitalizations from erythema, marked swelling, and pain. Assure good venous access prior to starting TREANDA infusion and monitor the intravenous infusion site for redness, swelling, pain, infection, and necrosis during and after administration of TREANDA.\n\n\n\n    5.8  Embryo-fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  TREANDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  Single intraperitoneal doses of bendamustine in mice and rats administered during organogenesis caused an increase in resorptions, skeletal and visceral malformations, and decreased fetal body weights.

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  ?  ELIQUIS can cause serious, potentially fatal bleeding. Promptly evaluate signs and symptoms of blood loss.(5.2) \n *  ?  Prosthetic heart valves: ELIQUIS use not recommended.(5.4) \n    \n   5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation\n\n  Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from ELIQUIS to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant  [see    Dosage and Administration (2.4)    andClinical Studies (14.1)]  .\n\n\n\n   5.2 Bleeding\n\n  ELIQUIS increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding  [see    Dosage and Administration (2.1)    andAdverse Reactions (6.1)]  .\n\n\n\n Concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding. These include aspirin and other antiplatelet agents, other anticoagulants, heparin, thrombolytic agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  [seeDrug Interactions (7.3)]  .\n\n\n\n Advise patients of signs and symptoms of blood loss and to report them immediately or go to an emergency room. Discontinue ELIQUIS in patients with active pathological hemorrhage.\n\n\n\n There is no established way to reverse the anticoagulant effect of apixaban, which can be expected to persist for at least 24 hours after the last dose, i.e., for about two drug half-lives. A specific antidote for ELIQUIS is not available. Hemodialysis does not appear to have a substantial impact on apixaban exposure  [seeClinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  . Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of apixaban. There is no experience with antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid) in individuals receiving apixaban. There is neither scientific rationale for reversal nor experience with systemic hemostatics (desmopressin and aprotinin) in individuals receiving apixaban. Use of procoagulant reversal agents such as prothrombin complex concentrate, activated prothrombin complex concentrate, or recombinant factor VIIa may be considered but has not been evaluated in clinical studies. Activated oral charcoal reduces absorption of apixaban, thereby lowering apixaban plasma concentration  [seeOverdosage (10)]  .\n\n\n\n   5.3 Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture\n\n  When neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural anesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, patients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis.\n\n\n\n The risk of these events may be increased by the postoperative use of indwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting hemostasis. Indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters should not be removed earlier than 24 hours after the last administration of ELIQUIS. The next dose of ELIQUIS should not be administered earlier than 5 hours after the removal of the catheter. The risk may also be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of ELIQUIS for 48 hours.\n\n\n\n Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment (e.g., numbness or weakness of the legs, bowel, or bladder dysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior to neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in anticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis.\n\n\n\n   5.4 Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves\n\n  The safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves. Therefore, use of ELIQUIS is not recommended in these patients.\n\n\n\n   5.5 Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy\n\n  Initiation of ELIQUIS is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of patients with PE who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy.\n",

(  5.6  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Gastrointestinal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain occur with BOSULIF treatment. Monitor and manage patients using standards of care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, and fluid replacement. In the single-arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial, the median time to onset for diarrhea (all grades) was 2 days and the median duration per event was 1 day. Among the patients who experienced diarrhea, the median number of episodes of diarrhea per patient during treatment with BOSULIF was 3 (range 1-221). To manage gastrointestinal toxicity, withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Myelosuppression\n\n\n\n  Thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia occur with BOSULIF treatment. Perform complete blood counts weekly for the first month of therapy and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. To manage myelosuppression, withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.3 Hepatic Toxicity\n\n\n\n  One case consistent with drug induced liver injury (defined as concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than or equal to 3*ULN with total bilirubin greater than 2*ULN and alkaline phosphatase less than 2*ULN) occurred in a trial of BOSULIF in combination with letrozole. The patient recovered fully following discontinuation of BOSULIF. This case represented 1 out of 1209 patients in BOSULIF clinical trials.\n\n\n\n In the 546 patients from the safety population, the incidence of ALT elevation was 17% and AST elevation was 14%. Twenty percent of the patients experienced an increase in either ALT or AST. Most cases of transaminase elevations occurred early in treatment; of patients who experienced transaminase elevations of any grade, more than 80% experienced their first event within the first 3 months. The median time to onset of increased ALT and AST was 30 and 33 days, respectively, and the median duration for each was 21 days.\n\n\n\n Perform hepatic enzyme tests monthly for the first three months of BOSULIF treatment and as clinically indicated. In patients with transaminase elevations, monitor liver enzymes more frequently. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4 Fluid Retention\n\n\n\n  Fluid retention occurs with BOSULIF and may manifest as pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and/or peripheral edema.\n\n\n\n In the single-arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial in 546 patients with CML treated with prior therapy, severe fluid retention was reported in 14 patients (3%). Specifically, 9 patients had a Grade 3 or 4 pleural effusion, 3 patients experienced both Grade 3 or Grade 4 pleural and pericardial effusions, 1 patient experienced Grade 3 peripheral and pulmonary edema, and 1 patient had a Grade 3 edema.\n\n\n\n Monitor and manage patients using standards of care. Interrupt, dose reduce or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Renal Toxicity\n\n\n\n   An on-treatment decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has occurred in patients treated with BOSULIF. Table 2 identifies the shift from baseline to lowest observed estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during BOSULIF therapy for patients in the global Ph+ Leukemia studies. The median duration of therapy with BOSULIF was approximately 17 months (range, 0.03 to 95) for patients in these studies.  \n\n\n\n Table 2: Shift from Baseline to Lowest Observed eGFR Group During Treatment Safety Population in Clinical Studies (n=818)Among the 818 patients, eGFR was missing in 5 patients at baseline or on-therapy. There were no patients with kidney failure at baseline. \n  Baseline             Follow Up    \n  Renal Function Status        n       Normaln (%)  Mildn (%)   Mild to Moderaten (%)  Moderate to Severen (%)  Severen (%)  Kidney Failuren (%)   \n  \n Notes: Grading is based on Modification in Diet in Renal Disease method (MDRD).KDIGO Classification by eGFR: Normal: greater than or equal to 90, Mild: 60 to less than 90, Mild to Moderate: 45 to less than 60, Moderate to Severe: 30 to less than 45, Severe: 15 to less than 30, Kidney Failure: less than 15 ml/min/1.73 m  2  .   \n  \n  Normal                  274       53 (19)     174 (64)     30 (11)        14 (5)        1 (<1)        1 (<1)        \n Mild                     438        10 (2)     170 (39)     177 (40)       63 (14)       14 (3)         2 (1)        \n Mild to Moderate          79          0         4 (5)       28 (35)        37 (47)      10 (13)           0          \n Moderate to Severe        24          0         1 (4)        1 (4)         6 (25)       15 (63)         1 (4)        \n Severe                    1           0           0            0              0            0           1 (100)       \n Total                    816        63 (8)     349 (43)     236 (29)      120 (15)       40 (5)         5 (1)        \n               Monitor renal function at baseline and during therapy with BOSULIF, with particular attention to those patients who have preexisting renal impairment or risk factors for renal dysfunction. Consider dose adjustment in patients with baseline and treatment emergent renal impairment [see  Dosage and Administration (2.7)  ].    \n \n\n    5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  There are no adequate and well controlled studies of BOSULIF in pregnant women. BOSULIF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Bosutinib caused embryofetal toxicities in rabbits at maternal exposures that were greater than the clinical exposure at the recommended bosutinib dose of 500 mg/day. Females of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy while being treated with BOSULIF. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .\n",

        "section_text": "    5     WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Bradycardia and/or atrioventricular conduction after first dose: Monitor patients. (  2  ,  5.1  ) \n *  Infections: GILENYA may increase the risk of infections. A recent CBC should be available before initiating treatment. Monitor for infection during treatment and for 2 months after discontinuation. Do not start in patients with active infections. (  5.2  ) \n *  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML); Withhold GILENYA at the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML. (  5.3  ) \n *  Macular edema: Perform an examination of the fundus including the macula before and 3-4 months after treatment initiation. Patients with diabetes mellitus or a history of uveitis are at increased risk. (  5.4  ) \n *  Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): If suspected, discontinue GILENYA. (  5.5  ) \n *  Decrease in pulmonary function tests (PFT): Obtain PFT when clinically indicated. (  5.6  ) \n *  Liver injury: liver enzyme results should be available before initiation. Discontinue if significant liver injury occurs. (  5.7  ) \n *  Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and for 2 months after stopping GILENYA. (  5.8  ) \n *  Blood pressure (BP): Monitor BP during treatment. (  5.9  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1     Bradyarrhythmia and Atrioventricular Blocks\n\n\n\n  Because of a risk for bradyarrhythmia and atrioventricular (AV) blocks, patients should be monitored during GILENYA treatment initiation [see Dosage and Administration (2)]  .\n\n\n\n   Reduction in Heart Rate    \n\n\n\n  After the first dose of GILENYA, the heart rate decrease starts within an hour. On Day 1, the maximum decline in heart rate generally occurs within 6 hours and recovers, although not to baseline levels, by 8 to 10 hours postdose. Because of physiological diurnal variation, there is a second period of heart rate decrease within 24 hours after the first dose. In some patients, heart rate decrease during the second period is more pronounced than the decrease observed in the first 6 hours. Heart rates below 40 beats per minute were rarely observed. In controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions of symptomatic bradycardia following the first dose were reported in 0.6% of patients receiving GILENYA 0.5 mg and in 0.1% of patients on placebo. Patients who experienced bradycardia were generally asymptomatic, but some patients experienced hypotension, dizziness, fatigue, palpitations, and/or chest pain that usually resolved within the first 24 hours on treatment.  \n\n\n\n Following the second dose, a further decrease in heart rate may occur when compared to the heart rate prior to the second dose, but this change is of a smaller magnitude than that observed following the first dose. With continued dosing, the heart rate returns to baseline within 1 month of chronic treatment.\n\n\n\n   Atrioventricular Blocks    \n\n\n\n  Initiation of GILENYA treatment has resulted in transient AV conduction delays. In controlled clinical trials, first-degree AV block after the first dose occurred in 4.7% of patients receiving GILENYA and 1.6% of patients on placebo. In a study of 697 patients with available 24-hour Holter monitoring data after their first dose (N=351 receiving GILENYA and N=346 on placebo), second-degree AV blocks (Mobitz Types I [Wenckebach] or 2:1 AV blocks) occurred in 4% (N=14) of patients receiving GILENYA and 2% (N=7) of patients on placebo. Of the 14 patients receiving GILENYA, 7 patients had 2:1 AV block (5 patients within the first 6 hours postdose and 2 patients after 6 hours postdose). All second degree AV blocks on placebo were Mobitz Type I and occurred after the first 12 hours postdose. The conduction abnormalities were usually transient and asymptomatic, and resolved within the first 24 hours on treatment, but they occasionally required treatment with atropine or isoproterenol.  \n\n\n\n  Postmarketing Experience  \n\n\n\n In the postmarketing setting, third-degree AV block and AV block with junctional escape have been observed during the first-dose 6-hour observation period with GILENYA. Isolated delayed onset events, including transient asystole and unexplained death, have occurred within 24 hours of the first dose. These events were confounded by concomitant medications and/or preexisting disease, and the relationship to GILENYA is uncertain. Cases of syncope were also reported after the first dose of GILENYA.\n\n\n\n    5.2     Infections\n\n\n\n   Risk of Infections  \n\n\n\n GILENYA causes a dose-dependent reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count to 20%-30% of baseline values because of reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues. GILENYA may therefore increase the risk of infections, some serious in nature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]  .\n\n\n\n  Before initiating treatment with GILENYA, a recent CBC (i.e., within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior therapy) should be available. Consider suspending treatment with GILENYA if a patient develops a serious infection, and reassess the benefits and risks prior to reinitiation of therapy. Because the elimination of fingolimod after discontinuation may take up to 2 months, continue monitoring for infections throughout this period. Instruct patients receiving GILENYA to report symptoms of infections to a physician. Patients with active acute or chronic infections should not start treatment until the infection(s) is resolved.  \n\n\n\n  In MS placebo-controlled trials, the overall rate of infections (72%) with GILENYA was similar to placebo. However, bronchitis, herpes zoster, influenza, sinusitis, and pneumonia were more common in GILENYA-treated patients. Serious infections occurred at a rate of 2.3% in the GILENYA group versus 1.6% in the placebo group.  \n\n\n\n   Herpes Viral Infections    \n\n\n\n  In placebo-controlled trials, the rate of herpetic infections was 9% in patients receiving GILENYA 0.5 mg and 7% on placebo.  \n\n\n\n  Two patients died of herpetic infections during controlled trials. One death was due to disseminated primary herpes zoster and the other to herpes simplex encephalitis. In both cases, the patients were taking a 1.25 mg dose of fingolimod (higher than the recommended 0.5 mg dose) and had received high-dose corticosteroid therapy to treat suspected MS relapses.  \n\n\n\n  Serious, life-threatening events of disseminated varicella zoster and herpes simplex infections, including cases of encephalitis and multiorgan failure, have occurred with GILENYA 0.5 mg in the postmarketing setting. One of these events was fatal. Include disseminated herpetic infections in the differential diagnosis of patients who are receiving GILENYA and present with an atypical MS relapse or multiorgan failure.  \n\n\n\n   Cryptococcal infections    \n\n\n\n  Cryptococcal infections, including cases of cryptococcal meningitis, have been reported with GILENYA in the postmarketing setting. Patients with symptoms and signs consistent with cryptococcal meningitis should undergo prompt diagnostic evaluation and treatment.  \n\n\n\n   Prior and Concomitant Treatment with Antineoplastic, Immunosuppressive, or Immune-Modulating Therapies    \n\n\n\n  In clinical studies, patients who received GILENYA did not receive concomitant treatment with antineoplastic, non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating therapies used for treatment of MS. Concomitant use of GILENYA with any of these therapies, and also with corticosteroids, would be expected to increase the risk of immunosuppression [see Drug Interactions (7)]  .  \n\n\n\n  When switching to GILENYA from immune-modulating or immunosuppressive medications, consider the duration of their effects and their mode of action to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects.  \n\n\n\n   Varicella Zoster Virus Antibody Testing/Vaccination    \n\n\n\n  Patients without a healthcare professional confirmed history of chickenpox or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against varicella zoster virus (VZV) should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating GILENYA. VZV vaccination of antibody-negative patients is recommended prior to commencing treatment with GILENYA, following which initiation of treatment with GILENYA should be postponed for 1 month to allow the full effect of vaccination to occur.  \n\n\n\n    5.3     Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy\n\n\n\n   A case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and a case of probable PML occurred in patients with MS who received GILENYA in the post marketing setting. PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. One patient developed PML after taking GILENYA for approximately 2.5 years. The other patient developed probable PML after taking GILENYA for approximately 4 years. The diagnosis of probable PML was based on MRI findings and the detection of JCV DNA in the CSF in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms specific to PML. The patients had no other identified systemic medical conditions resulting in compromised immune system function and had not previously been treated with natalizumab, which has a known association with PML. The patients were also not taking any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medications concomitantly.  \n\n\n\n  At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold GILENYA and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. MRI signs may be apparent before clinical symptoms. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.  \n\n\n\n    5.4     Macular Edema\n\n\n\n   Fingolimod increases the risk of macular edema. Perform an examination of the fundus including the macula in all patients before starting treatment, again 3-4 months after starting treatment, and again at any time after a patient reports visual disturbances while on GILENYA therapy.  \n\n\n\n  A dose-dependent increase in the risk of macular edema occurred in the GILENYA clinical development program.  \n\n\n\n  In 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with multiple sclerosis, macular edema with or without visual symptoms occurred in 1.5% of patients (11/799) treated with fingolimod 1.25 mg, 0.5% of patients (4/783) treated with GILENYA 0.5 mg and 0.4% of patients (3/773) treated with placebo. Macular edema occurred predominantly during the first 3 to 4 months of therapy. These clinical trials excluded patients with diabetes mellitus, a known risk factor for macular edema (see below Macular Edema in Patients with History of Uveitis or Diabetes Mellitus  ). Symptoms of macular edema included blurred vision and decreased visual acuity. Routine ophthalmological examination detected macular edema in some patients with no visual symptoms. Macular edema generally partially or completely resolved with or without treatment after drug discontinuation. Some patients had residual visual acuity loss even after resolution of macular edema. Macular edema has also been reported in patients taking GILENYA 0.5 mg in the postmarketing setting, usually within the first 6 months of treatment.  \n\n\n\n Continuation of GILENYA in patients who develop macular edema has not been evaluated. A decision on whether or not to discontinue GILENYA therapy should include an assessment of the potential benefits and risks for the individual patient. The risk of recurrence after rechallenge has not been evaluated.\n\n\n\n  Macular Edema in Patients with History of Uveitis or Diabetes Mellitus  \n\n\n\n  Patients with a history of uveitis and patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of macular edema during GILENYA therapy. The incidence of macular edema is also increased in MS patients with a history of uveitis. In the combined clinical trial experience with all doses of fingolimod, the rate of macular edema was approximately 20% in MS patients with a history of uveitis versus 0.6% in those without a history of uveitis. GILENYA has not been tested in MS patients with diabetes mellitus. In addition to the examination of the fundus including the macula prior to treatment and at 3-4 months after starting treatment, MS patients with diabetes mellitus or a history of uveitis should have regular follow-up examinations.  \n\n\n\n    5.5     Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome\n\n\n\n  There have been rare cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) reported in patients receiving GILENYA. Symptoms reported included sudden onset of severe headache, altered mental status, visual disturbances, and seizure. Symptoms of PRES are usually reversible but may evolve into ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. If PRES is suspected, GILENYA should be discontinued.\n\n\n\n    5.6     Respiratory Effects\n\n\n\n   Dose-dependent reductions in forced expiratory volume over 1 second (FEV1) and diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were observed in patients treated with GILENYA as early as 1 month after treatment initiation. In 2-year placebo-controlled trials, the reduction from baseline in the percent of predicted values for FEV1 at the time of last assessment on drug was 2.8% for GILENYA 0.5 mg and 1.0% for placebo. For DLCO, the reduction from baseline in percent of predicted values at the time of last assessment on drug was 3.3% for GILENYA 0.5 mg and 0.5% for placebo. The changes in FEV1 appear to be reversible after treatment discontinuation. There is insufficient information to determine the reversibility of the decrease of DLCO after drug discontinuation. In MS placebo-controlled trials, dyspnea was reported in 9% of patients receiving GILENYA 0.5 mg and 7% of patients receiving placebo. Several patients discontinued GILENYA because of unexplained dyspnea during the extension (uncontrolled) studies. GILENYA has not been tested in MS patients with compromised respiratory function.  \n\n\n\n Spirometric evaluation of respiratory function and evaluation of DLCO should be performed during therapy with GILENYA if clinically indicated.\n\n\n\n    5.7     Liver Injury\n\n\n\n  Elevations of liver enzymes may occur in patients receiving GILENYA. Recent (i.e., within last 6 months) transaminase and bilirubin levels should be available before initiation of GILENYA therapy.\n\n\n\n  In 2-year placebo-controlled clinical trials, elevation of liver transaminases to 3-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) or greater occurred in 14% of patients treated with GILENYA 0.5 mg and 3% of patients on placebo. Elevations 5-fold the ULN or greater occurred in 4.5% of patients on GILENYA and 1% of patients on placebo. The majority of elevations occurred within 6 to 9 months. In clinical trials, GILENYA was discontinued if the elevation exceeded 5 times the ULN. Serum transaminase levels returned to normal within approximately 2 months after discontinuation of GILENYA. Recurrence of liver transaminase elevations occurred with rechallenge in some patients.  \n\n\n\n Liver enzymes should be monitored in patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine. GILENYA should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed. Patients with preexisting liver disease may be at increased risk of developing elevated liver enzymes when taking GILENYA.\n\n\n\n Because GILENYA exposure is doubled in patients with severe hepatic impairment, these patients should be closely monitored, as the risk of adverse reactions is greater [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.8     Fetal Risk\n\n\n\n  Based on animal studies, GILENYA may cause fetal harm. Because it takes approximately 2 months to eliminate GILENYA from the body, women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy during and for 2 months after stopping GILENYA treatment.\n\n\n\n    5.9     Blood Pressure Effects\n\n\n\n  In MS controlled clinical trials, patients treated with GILENYA 0.5 mg had an average increase over placebo of approximately 3 mmHg in systolic pressure, and approximately 2 mmHg in diastolic pressure, first detected after approximately 1 month of treatment initiation, and persisting with continued treatment. Hypertension was reported as an adverse reaction in 8% of patients on GILENYA 0.5 mg and in 4% of patients on placebo. Blood pressure should be monitored during treatment with GILENYA.\n\n\n\n    5.10     Immune System Effects Following GILENYA Discontinuation\n\n\n\n  Fingolimod remains in the blood and has pharmacodynamic effects, including decreased lymphocyte counts, for up to 2 months following the last dose of GILENYA. Lymphocyte counts generally return to the normal range within 1-2 months of stopping therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]  . Because of the continuing pharmacodynamic effects of fingolimod, initiating other drugs during this period warrants the same considerations needed for concomitant administration (e.g., risk of additive immunosuppressant effects) [see Drug Interactions (7)]  .\n",

(  5.1  ) \n *    Serious Infections: Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents, including BENLYSTA. Use with caution in patients with chronic infections. Consider interrupting therapy with BENLYSTA if patients develop a new infection during treatment with BENLYSTA. (  5.2  ) \n *    Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML): Patients presenting with new-onset or deteriorating neurological signs and symptoms should be evaluated for PML by an appropriate specialist. If PML is confirmed, consider discontinuation of immunosuppressant therapy, including BENLYSTA. (  5.2  ) \n *    Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Anaphylaxis: Serious and fatal reactions have been reported. BENLYSTA should be administered by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis. Monitor patients during and for an appropriate period of time after administration of BENLYSTA. (  2.2  ,  5.4  ) \n *    Depression: Depression and suicidality have been reported in trials with BENLYSTA. Patients should be instructed to contact their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes. (  5.6  ) \n *    Immunization: Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with BENLYSTA. (  5.7  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Mortality\n\n\n\n  There were more deaths reported with BENLYSTA than with placebo during the controlled period of the clinical trials. Out of 2,133 patients in 3 clinical trials, a total of 14 deaths occurred during the placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment periods: 3/675 (0.4%), 5/673 (0.7%), 0/111 (0%), and 6/674 (0.9%) deaths in the groups receiving placebo, BENLYSTA 1 mg/kg, BENLYSTA 4 mg/kg, and BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg, respectively. No single cause of death predominated. Etiologies included infection, cardiovascular disease, and suicide.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Serious Infections\n\n\n\n  Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents, including BENLYSTA. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of BENLYSTA in patients with chronic infections. Patients receiving any therapy for chronic infection should not begin therapy with BENLYSTA. Consider interrupting therapy with BENLYSTA in patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with BENLYSTA and monitor these patients closely.\n\n\n\n In the controlled clinical trials, the overall incidence of infections was 71% in patients treated with BENLYSTA compared with 67% in patients who received placebo. The most frequent infections (>5% of patients receiving BENLYSTA) were upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, and influenza. Serious infections occurred in 6.0% of patients treated with BENLYSTA and in 5.2% of patients who received placebo. The most frequent serious infections included pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, and bronchitis. Infections leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 1.0% of patients receiving placebo. Infections resulting in death occurred in 0.3% (4/1,458) of patients treated with BENLYSTA and in 0.1% (1/675) of patients receiving placebo.\n\n\n\n  Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)  \n\n\n\n Cases of JC virus-associated PML resulting in neurological deficits, including fatal cases, have been reported in patients with SLE receiving immunosuppressants, including BENLYSTA. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset or deteriorating neurological signs and symptoms and consult with a neurologist or other appropriate specialist as clinically indicated. In patients with confirmed PML, consider stopping immunosuppressant therapy, including BENLYSTA.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Malignancy\n\n\n\n  The impact of treatment with BENLYSTA on the development of malignancies is not known. In the controlled clinical trials, malignancies (including non-melanoma skin cancers) were reported in 0.4% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.4% of patients receiving placebo. In the controlled clinical trials, malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, were observed in 0.2% (3/1,458) and 0.3% (2/675) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and placebo, respectively. The mechanism of action of BENLYSTA could increase the risk for the development of malignancies.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Anaphylaxis\n\n\n\n  Acute hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and death, have been reported in association with BENLYSTA. These events generally occurred within hours of the infusion; however, they may occur later. Non-acute hypersensitivity reactions including rash, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, headache, and facial edema, have been reported and typically occurred up to a week following the most recent infusion. Hypersensitivity, including serious reactions, has occurred in patients who have previously tolerated infusions of BENLYSTA. Limited data suggest that patients with a history of multiple drug allergies or significant hypersensitivity may be at increased risk. In the controlled clinical trials, hypersensitivity reactions (occurring on the same day of infusion) were reported in 13% (191/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 11% (76/675) of patients receiving placebo. Anaphylaxis was observed in 0.6% (9/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.4% (3/675) of patients receiving placebo. Manifestations included hypotension, angioedema, urticaria or other rash, pruritus, and dyspnea. Due to overlap in signs and symptoms, it was not possible to distinguish between hypersensitivity reactions and infusion reactions in all cases [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  ]  . Some patients (13%) received premedication, which may have mitigated or masked a hypersensitivity response; however, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether premedication diminishes the frequency or severity of hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n\n\n BENLYSTA should be administered by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis. In the event of a serious reaction, administration of BENLYSTA must be discontinued immediately and appropriate medical therapy administered. Patients should be monitored during and for an appropriate period of time after administration of BENLYSTA. Patients should be informed of the signs and symptoms of an acute hypersensitivity reaction and be instructed to seek immediate medical care should a reaction occur.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Infusion Reactions\n\n\n\n  In the controlled clinical trials, adverse events associated with the infusion (occurring on the same day of the infusion) were reported in 17% (251/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 15% (99/675) of patients receiving placebo. Serious infusion reactions (excluding hypersensitivity reactions) were reported in 0.5% of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.4% of patients receiving placebo and included bradycardia, myalgia, headache, rash, urticaria, and hypotension. The most common infusion reactions (>=3% of patients receiving BENLYSTA) were headache, nausea, and skin reactions. Due to overlap in signs and symptoms, it was not possible to distinguish between hypersensitivity reactions and infusion reactions in all cases [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  ]  . Some patients (13%) received premedication, which may have mitigated or masked an infusion reaction; however, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether premedication diminishes the frequency or severity of infusion reactions [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n BENLYSTA should be administered by healthcare providers prepared to manage infusion reactions. The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops an infusion reaction. Healthcare providers should be aware of the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, which may present as infusion reactions, and monitor patients closely.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Depression\n\n\n\n  In the controlled clinical trials, psychiatric events were reported more frequently with BENLYSTA (16%) than with placebo (12%), related primarily to depression-related events (6.3% BENLYSTA and 4.7% placebo), insomnia (6.0% BENLYSTA and 5.3% placebo), and anxiety (3.9% BENLYSTA and 2.8% placebo). Serious psychiatric events were reported in 0.8% of patients receiving BENLYSTA (0.6% and 1.2% with 1 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and 0.4% of patients receiving placebo. Serious depression was reported in 0.4% (6/1,458) of patients receiving BENLYSTA and 0.1% (1/675) of patients receiving placebo. Two suicides (0.1%) were reported in patients receiving BENLYSTA. The majority of patients who reported serious depression or suicidal behavior had a history of depression or other serious psychiatric disorders and most were receiving psychoactive medications. It is unknown if treatment with BENLYSTA is associated with increased risk for these events.\n\n\n\n Patients receiving BENLYSTA should be instructed to contact their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts, or other mood changes.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Immunization\n\n\n\n  Live vaccines should not be given for 30 days before or concurrently with BENLYSTA as clinical safety has not been established. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving BENLYSTA or the effect of BENLYSTA on new immunizations. Because of its mechanism of action, BENLYSTA may interfere with the response to immunizations.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Concomitant Use with Other Biologic Therapies or Intravenous Cyclophosphamide\n\n\n\n  BENLYSTA has not been studied in combination with other biologic therapies, including B-cell targeted therapies, or intravenous cyclophosphamide. Therefore, use of BENLYSTA is not recommended in combination with biologic therapies or intravenous cyclophosphamide.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Hepatotoxicity: Fatal hepatotoxicity occurred in 0.1% of patients. Monitor with periodic liver testing. Temporarily suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue XALKORI. (  5.1  ) \n *  Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: Occurred in 2.9% of patients. Permanently discontinue in patients with ILD/pneumonitis. (  5.2  ) \n *  QT Interval Prolongation: Occurred in 2.1% of patients. Monitor with electrocardiograms and electrolytes in patients who have a history of or predisposition for QTc prolongation, or who are taking medications that prolong QT. Temporarily suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue XALKORI. (  5.3  ) \n *  Bradycardia: XALKORI can cause bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. Temporarily suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue XALKORI. (  5.4  ) \n *  Severe Visual Loss: Reported in 0.2% of patients. Discontinue XALKORI in patients with severe visual loss. Perform an ophthalmological evaluation. (  5.5  ) \n *  Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. (  5.6  ,  8.1  ,  8.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hepatotoxicity\n\n\n\n   Drug-induced hepatotoxicity with fatal outcome occurred in 2 (0.1%) of the 1669 patients treated with XALKORI across clinical trials in patients with NSCLC. Concurrent elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than or equal to three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin greater than or equal to two times the ULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in 10 patients (0.6%) treated with XALKORI. Additionally, elevations in ALT or AST greater than five times the ULN occurred in 184 (11%) and 93 (5.7%) patients, respectively. Seventeen patients (1.0%) required permanent discontinuation due to elevated transaminases. Transaminase elevations generally occurred within the first 2 months of treatment.  \n\n\n\n Monitor with liver function tests including ALT and total bilirubin every 2 weeks during the first 2 months of treatment, then once a month and as clinically indicated, with more frequent repeat testing for increased liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin in patients who develop transaminase elevations. Temporarily suspend, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue XALKORI as described in Table 2 [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease (Pneumonitis)\n\n\n\n   Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with XALKORI. Across clinical trials (n=1669), 49 XALKORI-treated patients (2.9%) had ILD of any grade, 18 patients (1.1%) had Grade 3 or 4 ILD, and 8 patients (0.5%) had fatal ILD. These cases generally occurred within 3 months after the initiation of XALKORI.  \n\n\n\n Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Exclude other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis, and permanently discontinue XALKORI in patients diagnosed with drug-related ILD/pneumonitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.3 QT Interval Prolongation\n\n\n\n   QTc prolongation can occur in patients treated with XALKORI. Across clinical trials, 32 of 1560 patients (2.1%) had QTcF (corrected QT by the Fridericia method) greater than or equal to 500 ms and 76 of 1520 patients (5.0%) had an increase from baseline QTcF greater than or equal to 60 ms by automated machine-read evaluation of ECG.  \n\n\n\n Avoid use of XALKORI in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Consider periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, or who are taking medications that are known to prolong the QT interval. Permanently discontinue XALKORI in patients who develop QTc greater than 500 ms or greater than or equal to 60 ms change from baseline with Torsade de pointes or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia. Withhold XALKORI in patients who develop QTc greater than 500 ms on at least 2 separate ECGs until recovery to a QTc less than or equal to 480 ms, then resume XALKORI at a reduced dose as described in Table 2 [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)    and   Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4 Bradycardia\n\n\n\n   Symptomatic bradycardia can occur in patients receiving XALKORI. Across clinical trials, bradycardia occurred in 205 (12.3%) of 1669 patients treated with XALKORI. A total of 242 (14.9%) patients had a heart rate less than 50 beats per minute. In Studies 1 and 2, Grade 3 syncope occurred in 2.0% of XALKORI-treated patients and in 0.6% of the chemotherapy-treated patients.  \n\n\n\n Avoid using XALKORI in combination with other agents known to cause bradycardia (e.g., beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, clonidine and digoxin) to the extent possible. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. In cases of symptomatic bradycardia that is not life-threatening, hold XALKORI until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above, re-evaluate the use of concomitant medications, and adjust the dose of XALKORI. Permanently discontinue for life-threatening bradycardia due to XALKORI; however, if associated with concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia or hypotension, hold XALKORI until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above, and if concomitant medications can be adjusted or discontinued, restart XALKORI at 250 mg once daily with frequent monitoring [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Severe Visual Loss\n\n\n\n   Across all clinical trials, the incidence of Grade 4 visual field defect with vision loss was 0.2% (4/1669). Optic atrophy and optic nerve disorder have been reported as potential causes of vision loss.  \n\n\n\n  Discontinue XALKORI in patients with new onset of severe visual loss (best corrected vision less than 20/200 in one or both eyes). Perform an ophthalmological evaluation consisting of best corrected visual acuity, retinal photographs, visual fields, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and other evaluations as appropriate for new onset of severe visual loss. There is insufficient information to characterize the risks of resumption of XALKORI in patients with a severe visual loss; a decision to resume XALKORI should consider the potential benefits to the patient.  \n\n\n\n    5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n   Based on its mechanism of action, XALKORI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of crizotinib in pregnant rats during organogenesis at exposures similar to those observed with the maximum recommended human dose resulted in embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XALKORI and for at least 45 days following the final dose [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ]  .  \n",

(5.1)   \n *  Hypotension and reflex tachycardia are potential consequences of rapid upward titration of Cleviprex.  (5.2)   \n *  Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can produce negative inotropic effects and exacerbate heart failure. Monitor heart failure patients carefully.  (5.4)   \n *  Cleviprex gives no protection against the effects of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal.  (5.5)   \n *  Patients who receive prolonged Cleviprex infusions and are not transitioned to other antihypertensive therapies should be monitored for the possibility of rebound hypertension for at least 8 hours after the infusion is stopped.  (5.6)   \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Need for Aseptic Technique\n\n\n\n  Use aseptic technique and discard any unused product within 12 hours of stopper puncture   [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]    .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Hypotension and Reflex Tachycardia\n\n\n\n  Cleviprex may produce systemic hypotension and reflex tachycardia. If either occurs, decrease the dose of Cleviprex. There is limited experience with short-duration therapy with beta-blockers as a treatment for Cleviprex-induced tachycardia. Beta-blocker use for this purpose is not recommended.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Lipid Intake\n\n\n\n  Cleviprex contains approximately 0.2 g of lipid per mL (2.0 kcal). Lipid intake restrictions may be necessary for patients with significant disorders of lipid metabolism. For these patients, a reduction in the quantity of concurrently administered lipids may be necessary to compensate for the amount of lipid infused as part of the Cleviprex formulation.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Negative Inotropy\n\n\n\n  Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can produce negative inotropic effects and exacerbate heart failure. Monitor heart failure patients carefully.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Beta-Blocker Withdrawal\n\n\n\n  Cleviprex is not a beta-blocker, does not reduce heart rate, and gives no protection against the effects of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal. Beta-blockers should be withdrawn only after a gradual reduction in dose.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Rebound Hypertension\n\n\n\n  Patients who receive prolonged Cleviprex infusions and are not transitioned to other antihypertensive therapies should be monitored for the possibility of rebound hypertension for at least 8 hours after the infusion is stopped.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Pheochromocytoma\n\n\n\n  There is no information to guide use of Cleviprex in treating hypertension associated with pheochromocytoma.\n",

If anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reactions occur, immediately discontinue infusion and initiate appropriate medical treatment (5.1). \n *   Immune-Mediated Reactions: Monitor patients for the development of systemic immune-mediated reactions involving skin and other organs (5.2). \n *   Risk of Acute Cardiorespiratory Failure: Patients with compromised cardiac or respiratory function may be at risk of acute cardiorespiratory failure. Caution should be exercised when administering alglucosidase alfa to patients susceptible to fluid volume overload. Appropriate medical support and monitoring measures should be available during infusion (5.3). \n *   Risk of Cardiac Arrhythmia and Sudden Cardiac Death during General Anesthesia for Central Venous Catheter Placement: Caution should be used when administering general anesthesia for the placement of a central venous catheter intended for alglucosidase alfa infusion (5.4). \n    \n   5.1 Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n    Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in patients during and up to 3 hours after alglucosidase alfa infusion. Some of the reactions were life-threatening and included anaphylactic shock, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, respiratory distress, hypoxia, apnea, dyspnea, bradycardia, tachycardia, bronchospasm, throat tightness, hypotension, angioedema (including tongue or lip swelling, periorbital edema, and face edema), and urticaria. Other accompanying reactions included chest discomfort/pain, wheezing, tachypnea, cyanosis, decreased oxygen saturation, convulsions, pruritus, rash, hyperhidrosis, nausea, dizziness, hypertension/increased blood pressure, flushing/feeling hot, erythema, pyrexia, pallor, peripheral coldness, restlessness, nervousness, headache, back pain, and paresthesia. Some of these reactions were IgE-mediated.  \n\n\n\n If anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reactions occur, immediately discontinue administration of alglucosidase alfa, and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Severe reactions are generally managed with infusion interruption, administration of antihistamines, corticosteroids, intravenous fluids, and/or oxygen, when clinically indicated. In some cases of anaphylaxis, epinephrine has been administered. Appropriate medical support, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment, should be readily available when alglucosidase alfa is administered.\n\n\n\n The risks and benefits of re-administering alglucosidase alfa following an anaphylactic or hypersensitivity reaction should be considered. Some patients have been rechallenged and have continued to receive alglucosidase alfa under close clinical supervision. Extreme care should be exercised, with appropriate resuscitation measures available, if the decision is made to re-administer the product  [seeAdverse Reactions (6.2)]  .\n\n\n\n   5.2 Immune-Mediated Reactions\n\n  Immune-mediated cutaneous reactions have been reported with alglucosidase alfa including necrotizing skin lesions  [seeAdverse Reactions (6.3)]  . Systemic immune-mediated reactions, including possible type III immune-mediated reactions have been observed with alglucosidase alfa. These reactions occurred several weeks to 3 years after initiation of alglucosidase alfa infusions. Skin biopsy in one patient demonstrated deposition of anti-rhGAA antibodies in the lesion. Another patient developed severe inflammatory arthropathy in association with pyrexia and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Nephrotic syndrome secondary to membranous glomerulonephritis was observed in some Pompe disease patients treated with alglucosidase alfa who had persistently positive anti-rhGAA IgG antibody titers. In these patients, renal biopsy was consistent with immune complex deposition. Patients improved following treatment interruption. Therefore, patients receiving alglucosidase alfa should undergo periodic urinalysis  [seeAdverse Reactions (6.3)]  .\n\n\n\n Patients should be monitored for the development of systemic immune-mediated reactions involving skin and other organs while receiving alglucosidase alfa. If immune-mediated reactions occur, consider discontinuation of the administration of alglucosidase alfa, and initiate appropriate medical treatment. The risks and benefits of re-administering alglucosidase alfa following an immune-mediated reaction should be considered. Some patients have been able to be rechallenged and have continued to receive alglucosidase alfa under close clinical supervision.\n\n\n\n   5.3 Risk of Acute Cardiorespiratory Failure\n\n  Patients with acute underlying respiratory illness or compromised cardiac and/or respiratory function may be at risk of serious exacerbation of their cardiac or respiratory compromise during infusions. Appropriate medical support and monitoring measures should be readily available during alglucosidase alfa infusion, and some patients may require prolonged observation times that should be individualized based on the needs of the patient. Acute cardiorespiratory failure has been observed in infantile-onset Pompe disease patients with underlying cardiac hypertrophy, possibly associated with fluid overload with intravenous administration of alglucosidase alfa  [seeDosage and Administration (2.2)]  .\n\n\n\n   5.4 Risk of Cardiac Arrhythmia and Sudden Cardiac Death During General Anesthesia for Central Venous Catheter Placement\n\n    Administration of general anesthesia can be complicated by the presence of severe cardiac and skeletal (including respiratory) muscle weakness. Therefore, caution should be used when administering general anesthesia. Ventricular arrhythmias and bradycardia, resulting in cardiac arrest or death, or requiring cardiac resuscitation or defibrillation have been observed in infantile-onset Pompe disease patients with cardiac hypertrophy during general anesthesia for central venous catheter placement.  \n\n\n\n   5.5 Risk of Antibody Development\n\n    As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. In clinical studies, the majority of patients developed IgG antibodies to alglucosidase alfa, typically within 3 months of treatment. There is evidence to suggest that some patients who develop high and sustained IgG antibody titers may experience reduced clinical efficacy to alglucosidase alfa treatment, such as loss of motor function, ventilator dependence, or death. The effect of antibody development on the long term efficacy of alglucosidase alfa is not fully understood.  \n\n\n\n   Patients should be monitored for IgG antibody formation every 3 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter. Testing for IgG titers may also be considered if patients develop hypersensitivity reactions, other immune-mediated reactions, or lose clinical response. Patients who experience reduced clinical response may also be tested for inhibitory antibody activity. Patients who experience anaphylactic or hypersensitivity reactions may also be tested for IgE antibodies to alglucosidase alfa and other mediators of anaphylaxis  [seeAdverse Reactions (6.2)]  .  \n\n\n\n There are currently no marketed tests for antibodies against alglucosidase alfa; however, a testing service is provided by Genzyme. Contact your local Genzyme representative or Genzyme Corporation at 1-800-745-4447 for information on testing and to obtain a sample collection box.\n",

Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP3A metabolism pathways may significantly increase the exposure to eliglustat and result in prolongation of the PR, QTc, and/or QRS cardiac intervals that could result in cardiac arrhythmias [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  . Some drugs that are inhibitors of CYP2D6 and CYP3A are contraindicated with CERDELGA depending on the patient's CYP2D6 metabolizer status [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  . See  Table 3  and  Table 4  for other potentially significant drug interactions [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 ECG Changes and Potential for Cardiac Arrhythmias\n\n\n\n  Use of CERDELGA in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions has not been studied during clinical trials. Because CERDELGA is predicted to cause increases in ECG intervals (PR, QTc, and QRS) at substantially elevated eliglustat plasma concentrations, use of CERDELGA is not recommended in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease (congestive heart failure, recent acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia, heart block, ventricular arrhythmia), long QT syndrome, and in combination with Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) and Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  .\n",

Ensure safe handling to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure (  5.2  ).\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n   5.1 Risk for Image Misinterpretation and Other Errors\n\n\n\n  Errors may occur in the Neuraceq estimation of brain neuritic beta-amyloid plaque density during image interpretation [ see  Clinical Studies (14)    ]. Image interpretation should be performed independently of the patient's clinical information. The use of clinical information in the interpretation of Neuraceq images has not been evaluated and may lead to errors. Errors may also occur in cases with severe brain atrophy that limits the ability to distinguish gray and white matter on the Neuraceq scan. Errors may also occur due to motion artifacts that result in image distortion. Neuraceq scan results are indicative of the presence of brain neuritic beta-amyloid plaques only at the time of image acquisition and a negative scan result does not preclude the development of brain neuritic beta-amyloid plaques in the future.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Radiation Risk\n\n\n\n  Neuraceq, similar to other radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer.

Discontinue permanently if a clinically significant reaction occurs (  5.2  ) \n *  Hypocalcemia: Must be corrected before initiating Prolia. May worsen, especially in patients with renal impairment. Adequately supplement patients with calcium and vitamin D (  5.3  ) \n *  Osteonecrosis of the jaw: Has been reported with Prolia. Monitor for symptoms (  5.4  ) \n *  Atypical femoral fractures: Have been reported. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture (  5.5  ) \n *  Serious infections including skin infections: May occur, including those leading to hospitalization. Advise patients to seek prompt medical attention if they develop signs or symptoms of infection, including cellulitis (  5.6  ) \n *  Dermatologic reactions: Dermatitis, rashes, and eczema have been reported. Consider discontinuing Prolia if severe symptoms develop (  5.7  ) \n *  Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop (  5.8  ) \n *  Suppression of bone turnover: Significant suppression has been demonstrated. Monitor for consequences of bone oversuppression (  5.9  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Drug Products with Same Active Ingredient\n\n\n\n  Prolia contains the same active ingredient (denosumab) found in Xgeva. Patients receiving Prolia should not receive Xgeva.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Hypersensitivity\n\n\n\n  Clinically significant hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis has been reported with Prolia. Symptoms have included hypotension, dyspnea, throat tightness, facial and upper airway edema, pruritus, and urticaria. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, initiate appropriate therapy and discontinue further use of Prolia [see Contraindications (  4.3  ), Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.3 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism\n\n\n\n   Hypocalcemia may be exacerbated by the use of Prolia. Pre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with Prolia. In patients predisposed to hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism (e.g. history of hypoparathyroidism, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery, malabsorption syndromes, excision of small intestine, severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min] or receiving dialysis), clinical monitoring of calcium and mineral levels (phosphorus and magnesium) is highly recommended within 14 days of Prolia injection. In some postmarketing cases, hypocalcemia persisted for weeks or months and required frequent monitoring and intravenous and/or oral calcium replacement, with or without vitamin D.  \n\n\n\n Hypocalcemia following Prolia administration is a significant risk in patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min] or receiving dialysis. These patients may also develop marked elevations of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH).   Instruct all patients with severe renal impairment, including those receiving dialysis, about the symptoms of hypocalcemia and the importance of maintaining calcium levels with adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation.\n\n\n\n Adequately supplement all patients with calcium and vitamin D [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ), Contraindications (  4.1  ), Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ), and Patient Counseling Information (  17.3  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw\n\n\n\n   Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing. ONJ has been reported in patients receiving denosumab [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  A routine oral exam should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of Prolia treatment. A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry is recommended prior to treatment with Prolia in patients with risk factors for ONJ such as invasive dental procedures (e.g. tooth extraction, dental implants, oral surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g. chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g. periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). Good oral hygiene practices should be maintained during treatment with Prolia. Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ may increase the risk of developing ONJ.  \n\n\n\n For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit-risk assessment.\n\n\n\n Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on Prolia should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of Prolia therapy should be considered based on individual benefit-risk assessment.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures\n\n\n\n  Atypical low-energy or low trauma fractures of the shaft have been reported in patients receiving Prolia [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with anti-resorptive agents.\n\n\n\n Atypical femoral fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs.  A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisone) at the time of fracture.\n\n\n\n During Prolia treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patient presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of Prolia therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Serious Infections\n\n\n\n  In a clinical trial of over 7800 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, serious infections leading to hospitalization were reported more frequently in the Prolia group than in the placebo group [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Serious skin infections, as well as infections of the abdomen, urinary tract, and ear, were more frequent in patients treated with Prolia. Endocarditis was also reported more frequently in Prolia-treated patients. The incidence of opportunistic infections was similar between placebo and Prolia groups, and the overall incidence of infections was similar between the treatment groups. Advise patients to seek prompt medical attention if they develop signs or symptoms of severe infection, including cellulitis. \n\n\n\n Patients on concomitant immunosuppressant agents or with impaired immune systems may be at increased risk for serious infections. Consider the benefit-risk profile in such patients before treating with Prolia. In patients who develop serious infections while on Prolia, prescribers should assess the need for continued Prolia therapy.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Dermatologic Adverse Reactions\n\n\n\n  In a large clinical trial of over 7800 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, epidermal and dermal adverse events such as dermatitis, eczema, and rashes occurred at a significantly higher rate in the Prolia group compared to the placebo group. Most of these events were not specific to the injection site [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Consider discontinuing Prolia if severe symptoms develop.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Musculoskeletal Pain\n\n\n\n   In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking Prolia [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )]  . The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting Prolia. Consider discontinuing use if severe symptoms develop [see Patient Counseling Information (  17.8  )]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.9 Suppression of Bone Turnover\n\n\n\n  In clinical trials in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, treatment with Prolia resulted in significant suppression of bone remodeling as evidenced by markers of bone turnover and bone histomorphometry [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  ) and Clinical Studies (  14.1  )]  . The significance of these findings and the effect of long-term treatment with Prolia are unknown. The long-term consequences of the degree of suppression of bone remodeling observed with Prolia may contribute to adverse outcomes such as osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical fractures, and delayed fracture healing. Monitor patients for these consequences.\n",

(  5.1  ) \n *   QT prolongation: Prolongs QT interval and may be associated with arrhythmia and sudden death-consider using other antipsychotics first. Avoid use of FANAPT in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc; use caution and consider dose modification when prescribing FANAPT with other drugs that inhibit FANAPT metabolism. Monitor serum potassium and magnesium in patients at risk for electrolyte disturbances. (  1  ,  5.2  ,  7.1  ,  7.3  ,  12.3  ) \n *   Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: Manage with immediate discontinuation of drug and close monitoring. (  5.3  ) \n *   Tardive dyskinesia: Discontinue if clinically appropriate. (  5.4  ) \n *  *   Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus: Monitor patients for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients at risk for diabetes. (  5.5  ) \n *   Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. (  5.5  ) \n *   Weight Gain: Weight gain has been reported. Monitor weight. (  5.5  ) \n    Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. (  5.5  ) \n *   Seizures: Use cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower seizure threshold. (  5.6  ) \n *   Orthostatic hypotension: Dizziness, tachycardia, and syncope can occur with standing. (  5.7  ) \n *   Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis have been reported with antipsychotics. Patients with a pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or a history of leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue FANAPT at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. (  5.8  ) \n *   Suicide: Close supervision of high risk patients. (  5.12  ) \n *   Priapism: Cases have been reported in association with FANAPT treatment. (  5.13  ) \n *   Potential for cognitive and motor impairment: Use caution when operating machinery. (  5.14  ) \n *  See Full Prescribing Information for additional WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS.  \n    \n \n\n   5.1     Increased Risks in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\n\n\n\n   Increased Mortality  \n\n\n\n  Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo.   FANAPT   is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis       [s   ee Boxed Warning   ]   .  \n\n\n\n  Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke  \n\n\n\n In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks) including fatalities compared to placebo-treated patients. FANAPT is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis  [s   ee Boxed Warning   ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2     QT Prolongation\n\n\n\n  In an open-label QTc study in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (n=160), FANAPT was associated with QTc prolongation of 9 msec at an iloperidone dose of 12 mg twice daily. The effect of FANAPT on the QT interval was augmented by the presence of CYP450 2D6 or 3A4 metabolic inhibition (paroxetine 20 mg once daily and ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily, respectively). Under conditions of metabolic inhibition for both 2D6 and 3A4, FANAPT 12 mg twice daily was associated with a mean QTcF increase from baseline of about 19 msec.\n\n\n\n No cases of torsade de pointes or other severe cardiac arrhythmias were observed during the pre-marketing clinical program.\n\n\n\n The use of FANAPT should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc including Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications, antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone). FANAPT should also be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n\n\n Certain circumstances may increase the risk of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including (1) bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval; (5) recent acute myocardial infarction; and/or (6) uncompensated heart failure. \n\n\n\n Caution is warranted when prescribing FANAPT with drugs that inhibit FANAPT metabolism [see Drug Interaction   s   (7.1)]  , and in patients with reduced activity of CYP2D6 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  .\n\n\n\n It is recommended that patients being considered for FANAPT treatment who are at risk for significant electrolyte disturbances have baseline serum potassium and magnesium measurements with periodic monitoring. Hypokalemia (and/or hypomagnesemia) may increase the risk of QT prolongation and arrhythmia. FANAPT should be avoided in patients with histories of significant cardiovascular illness, e.g., QT prolongation, recent acute myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, or cardiac arrhythmia. FANAPT should be discontinued in patients who are found to have persistent QTc measurements >500 msec.\n\n\n\n If patients taking FANAPT experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias, e.g., dizziness, palpitations, or syncope, the prescriber should initiate further evaluation, including cardiac monitoring. \n\n\n\n    5.3     Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)\n\n\n\n  A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including FANAPT. Clinical manifestations include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.\n\n\n\n The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases in which the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.\n\n\n\n The management of this syndrome should include: (1) immediate discontinuation of the antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and (3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.\n\n\n\n If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.\n\n\n\n    5.4     Tardive Dyskinesia\n\n\n\n  Tardive dyskinesia is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, which may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely on prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.\n\n\n\n The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic administered increases. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.\n\n\n\n There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.\n\n\n\n Given these considerations, FANAPT should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.\n\n\n\n If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on FANAPT, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with FANAPT despite the presence of the syndrome.\n\n\n\n    5.5     Metabolic Changes\n\n\n\n  Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain [see Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]  . While all atypical antipsychotic drugs have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile.\n\n\n\n  Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus  \n\n\n\n Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including FANAPT. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics included in these studies. Because FANAPT was not marketed at the time these studies were performed, it is not known if FANAPT is associated with this increased risk.\n\n\n\n Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.\n\n\n\n Data from a 4-week, fixed-dose study in adult subjects with schizophrenia, in which fasting blood samples were drawn, are presented in Table 1.\n\n\n\n Table 1: Change in Fasting Glucose \n                                    FANAPT           \n                   Placebo          24 mg/day        \n                   Mean Change from Baseline(mg/dL)     \n                   n=114            n=228            \n  Serum Glucose Change from Baseline    -0.5             6.6               \n                   Proportion of Patients with Shifts     \n  Serum Glucose Normal to High    2.5 %            10.7 %            \n (<100 mg/dL to >=126 mg/dL)  (2/80)           (18/169)          \n         Pooled analyses of glucose data from clinical studies including longer term trials are shown in Table 2.\n \n\n Table 2: Change in Glucose \n  Mean Change from Baseline (mg/dL)     \n                   3-6 months       6-12 months      >12 months       \n FANAPT 10-16 mg/day  1.8 (N=773)      5.4 (N=723)      5.4 (N=425)       \n FANAPT 20-24 mg/day  -3.6 (N=34)      -9.0 (N=31)      -18.0 (N=20)      \n           Dyslipidemia  \n \n\n Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.\n\n\n\n Data from a placebo-controlled, 4-week, fixed-dose study, in which fasting blood samples were drawn, in adult subjects with schizophrenia are presented in Table 3.\n\n\n\n Table 3: Change in Fasting Lipids \n                                    FANAPT           \n                   Placebo          24 mg/day        \n                   Mean Change from Baseline (mg/dL)     \n  Cholesterol      n=114            n=228            \n  Change from baseline    -2.17            8.18              \n  LDL              n=109            n=217            \n  Change from baseline    -1.41            9.03              \n  HDL              n=114            n=228            \n  Change from baseline    -3.35            0.55              \n  Triglycerides     n=114            n=228            \n  Change from baseline    16.47            -0.83             \n                   Proportion of Patients with Shifts     \n  Cholesterol                                        \n  Normal to High    1.4%             3.6%              \n  (<200 mg/dL to >=240 mg/dL)    (1/72)           (5/141)           \n  LDL                                                \n  Normal to High    2.4%             1.1%              \n  (<100 mg/dL to >=160 mg/dL)    (1/42)           (1/90)            \n  HDL                                                \n  Normal to Low    23.8%            12.1%             \n  ( >=40 mg/dL to <40 mg/dL)    (19/80)          (20/166)          \n  Triglycerides                                       \n  Normal to High    8.3%             10.1%             \n  (<150 mg/dL to >=200 mg/dL)    (6/72)           (15/148)          \n         Pooled analyses of cholesterol and triglyceride data from clinical studies including longer term trials are shown in Tables 4 and 5.\n \n\n Table 4: Change in Cholesterol \n  Mean Change from Baseline (mg/dL)     \n                   3-6 months       6-12 months      >12 months       \n FANAPT 10-16 mg/day  -3.9 (N=783)     -3.9 (N=726)     -7.7 (N=428)      \n FANAPT 20-24 mg/day  -19.4 (N=34)     -23.2 (N=31)     -19.4 (N=20)      \n         Table 5: Change in Triglycerides \n  Mean Change from Baseline (mg/dL)     \n                   3-6 months       6-12 months      >12 months       \n FANAPT 10-16 mg/day  -8.9 (N=783)     -8.9 (N=726)     -17.7 (N=428)     \n FANAPT 20-24 mg/day  -26.6 (N=34)     -35.4 (N=31)     -17.7 (N=20)      \n           Weight Gain  \n \n\n Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended.\n\n\n\n Across all short- and long-term studies, the overall mean change from baseline at endpoint was 2.1 kg.\n\n\n\n Changes in body weight (kg) and the proportion of subjects with >=7% gain in body weight from 4 placebo-controlled, 4- or 6-week, fixed- or flexible-dose studies in adult subjects are presented in Table 6.\n\n\n\n Table 6: Change in Body Weight \n                                    FANAPT           FANAPT           \n                   Placebo          10-16 mg/day     20-24 mg/day     \n                  n=576            n=481            n=391             \n  Weight (kg)                                                         \n  Change from Baseline    -0.1             2.0              2.7               \n  Weight Gain                                                         \n  >=7% increase from Baseline    4%               12%              18%               \n             5.6     Seizures\n \n\n  In short-term placebo-controlled trials (4- to 6-weeks), seizures occurred in 0.1% (1/1344) of patients treated with FANAPT compared to 0.3% (2/587) on placebo. As with other antipsychotics, FANAPT should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimer's dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. \n\n\n\n    5.7     Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope\n\n\n\n  FANAPT can induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, and syncope. This reflects its alpha1-adrenergic antagonist properties. In double-blind placebo-controlled short-term studies, where the dose was increased slowly, as recommended above, syncope was reported in 0.4% (5/1344) of patients treated with FANAPT, compared with 0.2% (1/587) on placebo. Orthostatic hypotension was reported in 5% of patients given 20 to 24 mg/day, 3% of patients given 10 to 16 mg/day, and 1% of patients given placebo. More rapid titration would be expected to increase the rate of orthostatic hypotension and syncope. \n\n\n\n FANAPT should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, history of myocardial infarction, ischemia, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that predispose the patient to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications). Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension.\n\n\n\n    5.8     Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis\n\n\n\n  In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has also been reported.\n\n\n\n Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue FANAPT at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.\n\n\n\n Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm  3  ) should discontinue FANAPT and have their WBC followed until recovery.\n\n\n\n    5.9     Hyperprolactinemia\n\n\n\n  As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors, FANAPT elevates prolactin levels. \n\n\n\n Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadalsteroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male patients.\n\n\n\n Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro  , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Mammary gland proliferative changes and increases in serum prolactin were seen in mice and rats treated with FANAPT  [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]  . Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time.\n\n\n\n In a short-term placebo-controlled trial (4-weeks), the mean change from baseline to endpoint in plasma prolactin levels for the FANAPT 24 mg/day-treated group was an increase of 2.6 ng/mL compared to a decrease of 6.3 ng/mL in the placebo-group. In this trial, elevated plasma prolactin levels were observed in 26% of adults treated with FANAPT compared to 12% in the placebo-group. In the short-term trials, FANAPT was associated with modest levels of prolactin elevation compared to greater prolactin elevations observed with some other antipsychotic agents. In pooled analysis from clinical studies including longer term trials, in 3210 adults treated with iloperidone, gynecomastia was reported in 2 male subjects (0.1%) compared to 0% in placebo-treated patients, and galactorrhea was reported in 8 female subjects (0.2%) compared to 3 female subjects (0.5%) in placebo-treated patients.\n\n\n\n    5.10     Body Temperature Regulation\n\n\n\n  Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing FANAPT for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration.\n\n\n\n    5.11     Dysphagia\n\n\n\n  Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. FANAPT and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia [see Boxed Warning]  .\n\n\n\n    5.12     Suicide\n\n\n\n  The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illness, and close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for FANAPT should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose.\n\n\n\n    5.13     Priapism\n\n\n\n  Three cases of priapism were reported in the premarketing FANAPT program. Drugs with alpha-adrenergic blocking effects have been reported to induce priapism. FANAPT shares this pharmacologic activity. Severe priapism may require surgical intervention.\n\n\n\n    5.14     Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment\n\n\n\n  FANAPT, like other antipsychotics, has the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills. In short-term, placebo-controlled trials, somnolence (including sedation) was reported in 11.9% (104/874) of adult patients treated with FANAPT     at doses of 10 mg/day or greater versus 5.3% (31/587) treated with placebo. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with FANAPT does not affect them adversely.\n",

Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m  2  ) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. The risk appears lower for patients with chronic, moderate kidney disease (GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73m  2  ) and little, if any, for patients with chronic, mild kidney disease (GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m  2  ). NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs. Report any diagnosis of NSF following EOVIST administration to Bayer HealthCare (1-888-842-2937) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch).\n\n\n\n Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid (over hours to days) and usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly in the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced kidney toxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not reliably assess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example, age > 60 years, diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension), estimate the GFR through laboratory testing.\n\n\n\n Among the factors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA and degree of renal impairment at the time of exposure. Record the specific GBCA and the dose administrated to a patient. For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended EOVIST dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug prior to any re-administration. For patients receiving hemodialysis, physicians may consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration of a GBCA in order to enhance the contrast agent's elimination [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )  and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].  The usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions with cardiovascular, respiratory and cutaneous manifestations, ranging from mild to severe, including shock have uncommonly occurred following EOVIST administration [see Adverse Reactions (  6  )]  .\n\n\n\n *    Before EOVIST administration, assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media, bronchial asthma and allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to EOVIST. \n *    Administer EOVIST only in situations where trained personnel and therapies are promptly available for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, including personnel trained in resuscitation. \n    Most hypersensitivity reactions to EOVIST have occurred within half an hour after administration. Delayed reactions can occur up to several days after EOVIST administration. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during and following EOVIST administration.\n \n\n    5.3 Acute Kidney Injury\n\n\n\n  In patients with chronic renal impairment, acute kidney injury sometimes requiring dialysis has been observed with the use of some GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury might be lower with EOVIST due to its dual excretory pathways. Do not exceed the recommended dose; the risk of acute kidney injury may increase with higher than recommended doses.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions\n\n\n\n  Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of EOVIST. Extravasation into tissues during EOVIST administration may result in local tissue reactions. Strictly avoid intramuscular administration of EOVIST because it may cause myocyte necrosis and inflammation [see Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.2  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Interference with Laboratory Tests\n\n\n\n  Serum iron determination using complexometric methods (for example, ferrocene complexation method) may result in falsely high or low values for up to 24 hours after the examination with EOVIST because of the caloxetate trisodium excipients [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.6 Interference with Visualization of Liver Lesions\n\n\n\n  Severe renal or hepatic failure may impair EOVIST imaging performance. In patients with end-stage renal failure, hepatic contrast was markedly reduced and was attributed to elevated serum ferritin levels. In patients with abnormally high (>3 mg/dL) serum bilirubin, reduced hepatic contrast was observed. If EOVIST is used in these patients, complete MRI no later than 60 minutes after EOVIST administration and use a paired non-contrast and contrast MRI set for diagnosis.\n",

        "section_text": "     5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Somnolence or Sedation: Monitor for central nervous system (CNS) depression. Risk may be increased with concomitant use of other CNS depressants. (  5.1  ,  5.2  ) \n *  Withdrawal: Symptoms may occur with rapid dose reduction or discontinuation. Discontinue ONFI gradually. (  5.3  ) \n *  Serious Dermatological Reactions(including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis):Discontinue ONFI at first sign of rash unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. (  5.4  ) \n *  Physical and Psychological Dependence: Monitor patients with a history of substance abuse for signs of habituation and dependence (  5.5  ,  9  ) \n *  Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor for suicidal thoughts or behaviors (  5.6  ) \n    \n \n\n    5.1 Somnolence or Sedation  \n\n\n\n  ONFI causes somnolence and sedation. In clinical trials, somnolence or sedation was reported at all effective doses and was dose-related.\n\n\n\n In general, somnolence and sedation begin within the first month of treatment and may diminish with continued treatment. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation, particularly with concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants. Prescribers should caution patients against engaging in hazardous activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating dangerous machinery or motor vehicles, until the effect of ONFI is known.\n\n\n\n     5.2 Potentiation of Sedation from Concomitant Use with Central Nervous System Depressants  \n\n\n\n  Since ONFI has a central nervous system (CNS) depressant effect, patients or their caregivers should be cautioned against simultaneous use with other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol, and cautioned that the effects of other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol may be potentiated.\n\n\n\n     5.3 Withdrawal Symptoms  \n\n\n\n  Abrupt discontinuation of ONFI should be avoided. ONFI should be tapered by decreasing the dose every week by 5-10 mg/day until discontinuation [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .\n\n\n\n Withdrawal symptoms occurred following abrupt discontinuation of ONFI; the risk of withdrawal symptoms is greater with higher doses.\n\n\n\n As with all antiepileptic drugs, ONFI should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the risk of precipitating seizures, seizure exacerbation, or status epilepticus.\n\n\n\n Withdrawal symptoms (e.g., convulsions, psychosis, hallucinations, behavioral disorder, tremor, and anxiety) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines. The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to patients who received excessive doses over an extended period of time, followed by an abrupt discontinuation. Generally milder withdrawal symptoms (e.g., dysphoria, anxiety, and insomnia) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic doses for several months.\n\n\n\n     5.4 Serious Dermatological Reactions  \n\n\n\n  Serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported with ONFI in both children and adults during the post-marketing period.  Patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of SJS/TEN, especially during the first 8 weeks of treatment initiation or when re-introducing therapy. ONFI should be discontinued at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered [see Contraindications (  4  )].  \n\n\n\n     5.5 Physical and Psychological Dependence  \n\n\n\n  Patients with a history of substance abuse should be under careful surveillance when receiving ONFI or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition of such patients to habituation and dependence [see   Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9  )]  .\n\n\n\n     5.6 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation  \n\n\n\n  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including ONFI, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.\n\n\n\n Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted relative risk 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug treated patients in the trials and none in placebo treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\n\n\n\n The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.\n\n\n\n The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.\n\n\n\n Table 2. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis \n  Indication         Placebo Patients with    Events per 1000 Patients       Drug Patients with   Events per 1000 Patients         Relative Risk: Incidence of Drug  Events in Drug Patients/Incidencein Placebo Patients         Risk Difference: Additional  Drug Patients with Events per 1000 Patients       \n    Epilepsy      1.0              3.4              3.5              2.4               \n    Psychiatric     5.7              8.5              1.5              2.9               \n    Other         1.0              1.8              1.9              0.9               \n    Total         2.4              4.3              1.8              1.9               \n           The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.\n \n\n Anyone considering prescribing ONFI or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.\n\n\n\n Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.\n",

The incidence of Grade >=3 hemorrhagic events was higher in COMETRIQ-treated patients compared with placebo (3% vs. 1%).\n\n\n\n Do not administer COMETRIQ to patients with a recent history of hemorrhage or hemoptysis.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Thrombotic Events\n\n\n\n  COMETRIQ treatment results in an increased incidence of thrombotic events (venous thromboembolism: 6% vs. 3% and arterial thromboembolism: 2% vs. 0% in COMETRIQ-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively).\n\n\n\n Discontinue COMETRIQ in patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction or any other clinically significant arterial thromboembolic complication.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Wound Complications\n\n\n\n  Wound complications have been reported with COMETRIQ. Stop treatment with COMETRIQ at least 28 days prior to scheduled surgery. Resume COMETRIQ therapy after surgery based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. Withhold COMETRIQ in patients with dehiscence or wound healing complications requiring medical intervention.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Hypertension\n\n\n\n  COMETRIQ treatment results in an increased incidence of treatment-emergent hypertension with Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (modified JNC criteria) stage 1 or 2 hypertension identified in 61% in COMETRIQ-treated patients compared with 30% of placebo-treated patients in the randomized trial. Monitor blood pressure prior to initiation and regularly during COMETRIQ treatment. Withhold COMETRIQ for hypertension that is not adequately controlled with medical management; when controlled, resume COMETRIQ at a reduced dose. Discontinue COMETRIQ for severe hypertension that cannot be controlled with anti-hypertensive therapy.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw\n\n\n\n  Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) occurred in 1% of COMETRIQ-treated patients. ONJ can manifest as jaw pain, osteomyelitis, osteitis, bone erosion, tooth or periodontal infection, toothache, gingival ulceration or erosion, persistent jaw pain or slow healing of the mouth or jaw after dental surgery. Perform an oral examination prior to initiation of COMETRIQ and periodically during COMETRIQ therapy. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices. For invasive dental procedures, withhold COMETRIQ treatment for at least 28 days prior to scheduled surgery, if possible.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES) occurred in 50% of patients treated with COMETRIQ and was severe (>= Grade 3) in 13% of patients. Withhold COMETRIQ in patients who develop intolerable Grade 2 PPES or Grade 3-4 PPES until improvement to Grade 1; resume COMETRIQ at a reduced dose.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Proteinuria\n\n\n\n  Proteinuria was observed in 4 (2%) of patients receiving COMETRIQ, including one with nephrotic syndrome, as compared to none of the patients receiving placebo. Monitor urine protein regularly during COMETRIQ treatment. Discontinue COMETRIQ in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome.\n\n\n\n    5.9 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by characteristic finding on MRI, occurred in one (<1%) patient. Perform an evaluation for RPLS in any patient presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. Discontinue COMETRIQ in patients who develop RPLS.\n\n\n\n    5.10 Drug Interactions\n\n\n\n  Avoid administration of COMETRIQ with agents that are strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors [see   Dosage and Administration   (  2.1  ) and   Drug Interactions   (  7.1  ,  7.2  )].  \n\n\n\n    5.11 Hepatic Impairment\n\n\n\n  COMETRIQ is not recommended for use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see   Use in Specific Populations   (  8.6  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.12 Embryo-fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  COMETRIQ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Cabozantinib was embryolethal in rats at exposures below the recommended human dose, with increased incidences of skeletal variations in rats and visceral variations and malformations in rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [See   Use in Specific Populations   (  8.1  )].  \n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *     Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD) : increased risk, predominantly involving the CNS; monitor for new or worsening neurological, cognitive, or behavioral signs and symptoms.  (Boxed Warning  ,  4  ,  5.1  ,  5.6)   \n *     Other malignancies : increased risk with all immunosuppressants; appears related to intensity and duration of use. Avoid prolonged exposure to UV light and sunlight.  (5.3)   \n *     Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) : increased risk; consider in the diagnosis of patients reporting new or worsening neurological, cognitive, or behavioral signs and symptoms. Recommended doses of immunosuppressants should not be exceeded.  (5.4)   \n *     Other serious infections : increased risk of bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections and tuberculosis. Some infections were fatal. Polyoma virus-associated nephropathy can lead to kidney graft loss; consider reduction in immunosuppression. Evaluate for tuberculosis and initiate treatment for latent infection prior to NULOJIX use. Cytomegalovirus and pneumocystis prophylaxis are recommended after transplantation.  (5.1  ,  5.4  ,  5.5)   \n *     Liver transplant : use is not recommended.  (5.6)   \n *     Acute Rejection and Graft Loss with Corticosteroid Minimization : corticosteroid utilization should be consistent with the NULOJIX clinical trial experience.  (2.1  ,  5.7  ,  14.1)   \n *     Immunizations : avoid use of live vaccines during treatment.  (5.8)   \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder\n\n\n\n  NULOJIX-treated patients have an increased risk for developing post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), predominantly involving the CNS, compared to patients on a cyclosporine-based regimen [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    and Table 2  ]. As the total burden of immunosuppression is a risk factor for PTLD, higher than the recommended doses or more frequent dosing of NULOJIX and higher than recommended doses of concomitant immunosuppressive agents are not recommended [see   Dosage and Administration (2.1)    and   Warnings and Precautions (5.6)    ]. Physicians should consider PTLD in patients reporting new or worsening neurological, cognitive, or behavioral signs or symptoms.\n\n\n\n    EBV Serostatus\n\n\n\n  The risk of PTLD was higher in EBV seronegative patients compared to EBV seropositive patients. EBV seropositive patients are defined as having evidence of acquired immunity shown by the presence of IgG antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA) and EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA).\n\n\n\n Epstein-Barr virus serology should be ascertained before starting administration of NULOJIX, and only patients who are EBV seropositive should receive NULOJIX. Transplant recipients who are EBV seronegative, or with unknown serostatus, should not receive NULOJIX [see   Boxed Warning    and   Contraindications (4)    ].\n\n\n\n    Other Risk Factors\n\n\n\n  Other known risk factors for PTLD include cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and T-cell-depleting therapy. T-cell-depleting therapies to treat acute rejection should be used cautiously. CMV prophylaxis is recommended for at least 3 months after transplantation [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.5)    ].\n\n\n\n Patients who are EBV seropositive and CMV seronegative may be at increased risk for PTLD compared to patients who are EBV seropositive and CMV seropositive [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Since CMV seronegative patients are at increased risk for CMV disease (a known risk factor for PTLD), the clinical significance of CMV serology for PTLD remains to be determined; however, these findings should be considered when prescribing NULOJIX.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Management of Immunosuppression\n\n\n\n  Only physicians experienced in management of systemic immunosuppressant therapy in transplantation should prescribe NULOJIX. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for the maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient [see   Boxed Warning    ].\n\n\n\n    5.3 Other Malignancies\n\n\n\n  Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including NULOJIX, are at increased risk of developing malignancies, in addition to PTLD, including the skin [see   Boxed Warning    and   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ]. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy\n\n\n\n  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an often rapidly progressive and fatal opportunistic infection of the CNS that is caused by the JC virus, a human polyoma virus. In clinical trials with NULOJIX, two cases of PML were reported in patients receiving NULOJIX at higher cumulative doses and more frequently than the recommended regimen, along with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids; one case occurred in a kidney transplant recipient and the second case occurred in a liver transplant recipient [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.6)    ]. As PML has been associated with high levels of overall immunosuppression, the recommended doses and frequency of NULOJIX and concomitant immunosuppressives, including MMF, should not be exceeded.\n\n\n\n Physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening neurological, cognitive, or behavioral signs or symptoms. PML is usually diagnosed by brain imaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and/or brain biopsy. Consultation with a specialist (e.g., neurologist and/or infectious disease) should be considered for any suspected or confirmed cases of PML.\n\n\n\n If PML is diagnosed, consideration should be given to reduction or withdrawal of immunosuppression taking into account the risk to the allograft.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Other Serious Infections\n\n\n\n  Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including NULOJIX, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral (cytomegalovirus [CMV] and herpes), fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes [see   Boxed Warning    and   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].\n\n\n\n Prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus is recommended for at least 3 months after transplantation. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci  is recommended after transplantation.\n\n\n\n    Tuberculosis\n\n\n\n  Tuberculosis was more frequently observed in patients receiving NULOJIX than cyclosporine in clinical trials [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis and tested for latent infection prior to initiating NULOJIX. Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection should be initiated prior to NULOJIX use.\n\n\n\n    Polyoma Virus Nephropathy\n\n\n\n  In addition to cases of JC virus-associated PML [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.4)    ], cases of polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), mostly due to BK virus infection, have been reported. PVAN is associated with serious outcomes; including deteriorating renal function and kidney graft loss [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN. Reductions in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of PVAN. Physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Liver Transplant\n\n\n\n  Use of NULOJIX in liver transplant patients is not recommended [see   Boxed Warning    ]. In a clinical trial of liver transplant patients, use of NULOJIX regimens with more frequent administration of belatacept than any of those studied in kidney transplant, along with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, was associated with a higher rate of graft loss and death compared to the tacrolimus control arms. In addition, two cases of PTLD involving the liver allograft (one fatal) and one fatal case of PML were observed among the 147 patients randomized to NULOJIX. The two cases of PTLD were reported among the 140 EBV seropositive patients (1.4%). The fatal case of PML was reported in a patient receiving higher than recommended doses of NULOJIX and MMF [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.4)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.7 Acute Rejection and Graft Loss with Corticosteroid Minimization\n\n\n\n  In postmarketing experience, use of NULOJIX in conjunction with basiliximab induction, MMF, and corticosteroid minimization to 5 mg per day between Day 3 and Week 6 post-transplant was associated with an increased rate and grade of acute rejection, particularly Grade III rejection. These Grade III rejections occurred in patients with 4 to 6 HLA mismatches. Graft loss was a consequence of Grade III rejection in some patients.\n\n\n\n Corticosteroid utilization should be consistent with the NULOJIX clinical trial experience [see   Dosage and Administration (2.1)    and   Clinical Studies (14.1)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.8 Immunizations\n\n\n\n  The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with NULOJIX, including but not limited to the following: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines.\n",

        "section_text": "    5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Diarrhea: Diarrhea may result in dehydration and renal failure. Withhold GILOTRIF for severe and prolonged diarrhea not responsive to anti-diarrheal agents. (2.3,5.1) \n *  Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Disorders: Severe bullous, blistering, and exfoliating lesions occurred in 0.15% of patients. Discontinue for life-threatening cutaneous reactions. Withhold GILOTRIF for severe and prolonged cutaneous reactions. (2.3,5.2) \n *  Interstitial lung disease (ILD): Occurs in 1.5% of patients. Withhold GILOTRIF for acute onset or worsening of pulmonary symptoms. Discontinue GILOTRIF if ILD is diagnosed. (2.3,5.3) \n *  Hepatic toxicity: Fatal hepatic impairment occurs in 0.18% of patients. Monitor with periodic liver testing. Withhold or discontinue GILOTRIF for severe or worsening liver tests. (2.3,5.4) \n *  Keratitis: Occurs in 0.8% of patients. Withhold GILOTRIF for keratitis evaluation. Withhold or discontinue GILOTRIF for confirmed ulcerative keratitis. (2.3,5.5) \n *  Embryofetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of the potential hazard to the fetus and to use highly effective contraception. (5.6) \n    \n   5.1 Diarrhea\n\n  Diarrhea has resulted in dehydration with or without renal impairment; some of these cases were fatal. In Study 1, diarrhea occurred in 96% of patients treated with GILOTRIF (n=229), of which 15% was Grade 3 in severity and occurred within the first 6 weeks  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].  Renal impairment as a consequence of diarrhea occurred in 6.1% of patients treated with GILOTRIF, out of which 3 (1.3%) were Grade 3.\n\n\n\n For patients who develop prolonged Grade 2 diarrhea lasting more than 48 hours or greater than or equal to Grade 3 diarrhea, withhold GILOTRIF until diarrhea resolves to Grade 1 or less, and resume GILOTRIF with appropriate dose reduction  [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].  Provide patients with an anti-diarrheal agent (e.g., loperamide) for self-administration at the onset of diarrhea and instruct patients to continue anti-diarrheal therapy until loose bowel movements cease for 12 hours.\n\n\n\n   5.2 Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Disorders\n\n  Grade 3 cutaneous reactions characterized by bullous, blistering, and exfoliating lesions occurred in 6 (0.15%) of the 3865 patients who received GILOTRIF across clinical trials  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].  In Study 1, the overall incidence of cutaneous reactions consisting of rash, erythema, and acneiform rash was 90%, and the incidence of Grade 3 cutaneous reactions was 16%. In addition, the incidence of Grade 1-3 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome was 7%. Discontinue GILOTRIF in patients who develop life-threatening bullous, blistering, or exfoliating lesions  [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].  For patients who develop prolonged Grade 2 cutaneous adverse reactions lasting more than 7 days, intolerable Grade 2, or Grade 3 cutaneous reactions, withhold GILOTRIF until the adverse reaction resolves to Grade 1 or less, and resume GILOTRIF with appropriate dose reduction  [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  .\n\n\n\n   5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)\n\n  ILD or ILD-like adverse reactions (e.g., lung infiltration, pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or alveolitis allergic) occurred in 1.5% of the 3865 patients who received GILOTRIF across clinical trials; of these, 0.4% were fatal. The incidence of ILD appeared to be higher in patients of Asian ethnicity (2.1%) as compared to non-Asians (1.2%). In Study 1, the incidence of Grade >=3 ILD was 1.3% and resulted in death in 1% of GILOTRIF-treated patients.\n\n\n\n Withhold GILOTRIF during evaluation of patients with suspected ILD, and discontinue GILOTRIF in patients with confirmed ILD  [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  .\n\n\n\n   5.4 Hepatic Toxicity\n\n  In 3865 patients who received GILOTRIF across clinical trials, 10.1% had liver test abnormalities, of which 7 (0.18%) were fatal. In Study 1, liver test abnormalities of any grade occurred in 17.5% of the patients treated with GILOTRIF.\n\n\n\n Obtain periodic liver testing in patients during treatment with GILOTRIF. Withhold GILOTRIF in patients who develop worsening of liver function  [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  . In patients who develop severe hepatic impairment while taking GILOTRIF, treatment should be discontinued.\n\n\n\n   5.5 Keratitis\n\n  Keratitis, characterized as acute or worsening eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain, and/or red eye occurred in 0.8% of patients treated with GILOTRIF among 3865 patients across clinical trials. Keratitis was reported in 5 (2.2%) patients in Study 1, with Grade 3 in 1 (0.4%). Withhold GILOTRIF during evaluation of patients with suspected keratitis, and if diagnosis of ulcerative keratitis is confirmed, treatment with GILOTRIF should be interrupted or discontinued  [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  . If keratitis is diagnosed, the benefits and risks of continuing treatment should be carefully considered. GILOTRIF should be used with caution in patients with a history of keratitis, ulcerative keratitis, or severe dry eye  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  . Contact lens use is also a risk factor for keratitis and ulceration.\n\n\n\n   5.6 Embryofetal Toxicity\n\n  Based on its mechanism of action, GILOTRIF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Afatinib was embryotoxic and, in animals with maternal toxicity, led to abortions at late gestational stages in rabbits at doses of 5 mg/kg (approximately 0.2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 40 mg daily) or greater. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus  [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].  \n\n\n\n Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment, and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose of GILOTRIF. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking GILOTRIF  [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1and8.6)].  \n",

Have anaphylactic and hypersensitivity treatment measures available prior to DaTscan administration. (  5.1  ) \n *  Administer a thyroid-blocking agent before DaTscan administration. (  5.2  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following DaTscan administration [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)    ]. The reactions have generally consisted of skin erythema and pruritis and have either resolved spontaneously or following the administration of corticosteroids and anti-histamines. Prior to administration, question the patient for a history of prior reactions to DaTscan. If the patient is known or strongly suspected of having had a hypersensitivity reaction to DaTscan, the decision to administer DaTscan should be based upon an assessment of the expected benefits compared to the potential hypersensitivity risks. Have anaphylactic and hypersensitivity treatment measures available prior to DaTscan administration and, following administration, observe patients for symptoms or signs of a hypersensitivity reaction.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Thyroid Accumulation\n\n\n\n  The DaTscan injection may contain up to 6% of free iodide (iodine 123). To decrease thyroid accumulation of iodine 123, block the thyroid gland before administration of DaTscan [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ]. Avoid the use of Potassium Iodide Oral Solution or Lugol's Solution in patients who are sensitive to such products. Failure to block thyroid uptake of iodine 123 may result in an increased long term risk for thyroid neoplasia.\n",

In 255 HAE patients treated with intravenous or subcutaneous KALBITOR in clinical studies, 10 patients (4%) experienced anaphylaxis. For the subgroup of 187 patients treated with subcutaneous KALBITOR, 5 patients (3%) experienced anaphylaxis. Symptoms associated with these reactions have included chest discomfort, flushing, pharyngeal edema, pruritus, rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, throat irritation, urticaria, wheezing, and hypotension. These reactions occurred within the first hour after dosing.\n\n\n\n Other adverse reactions indicative of hypersensitivity reactions included the following: pruritus (5%), rash (3%), and urticaria (2%).\n\n\n\n Patients should be observed for an appropriate period of time after administration of KALBITOR, taking into account the time to onset of anaphylaxis seen in clinical trials.  Given the similarity in hypersensitivity symptoms and acute HAE symptoms, patients should be monitored closely in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction.\n\n\n\n KALBITOR should not be administered to any patients with known clinical hypersensitivity to KALBITOR [ see Contraindications  (4)    ].\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor for suicidal thoughts or behavior. (  5.1  ) \n *  Serious Dermatologic Reactions, Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), Anaphylactic Reactions and Angioedema: Monitor and discontinue if another cause cannot be established. (  5.2  ,  5.3  ,  5.4  ) \n *  Hyponatremia: Monitor sodium levels in patients at risk or patients experiencing hyponatremia symptoms. (  5.5  ) \n *  Neurological Adverse Reactions: Monitor for dizziness, disturbance in gait and coordination, somnolence, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and visual changes. Use caution when driving or operating machinery. (  5.6  ) \n *  Withdrawal of APTIOM: Withdraw APTIOM gradually to minimize the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. (  2.6  ,  5.7  ) \n *  Drug Induced Liver Injury: Discontinue APTIOM in patients with jaundice or evidence of significant liver injury. (  5.8  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation\n\n\n\n  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including APTIOM, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.\n\n\n\n Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\n\n\n\n The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.\n\n\n\n The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.\n\n\n\n   Table 2  shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.\n\n\n\n Table 2: Risk of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis \n Indication            Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients  Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients  Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients  Risk Differences: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients   \n Epilepsy              1.0                   3.4                   3.5                   2.4                    \n Psychiatric           5.7                   8.5                   1.5                   2.9                    \n Other                 1.0                   1.8                   1.9                   0.9                    \n Total                 2.4                   4.3                   1.8                   1.9                    \n           The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials in patients with epilepsy than in clinical trials in patients with psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for epilepsy and psychiatric indications.\n \n\n Anyone considering prescribing APTIOM or any other AED must balance this risk with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.\n\n\n\n Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression; any unusual changes in mood or behavior; or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Serious Dermatologic Reactions\n\n\n\n  Serious dermatologic reactions including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) have been reported in association with APTIOM use. Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and SJS, have been reported in patients using oxcarbazepine or carbamazepine which are chemically related to APTIOM. The reporting rate of these reactions associated with oxcarbazepine use exceeds the background incidence rate estimates by a factor of 3- to 10-fold. Risk factors for development of serious dermatologic reactions with APTIOM use have not been identified.\n\n\n\n If a patient develops a dermatologic reaction while taking APTIOM, discontinue APTIOM use, unless the reaction is clearly not drug-related. Patients with a prior dermatologic reaction with either oxcarbazepine or APTIOM should not be treated with APTIOM [see Contraindications (  4  )].  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity\n\n\n\n  Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking APTIOM. DRESS may be fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. APTIOM should be discontinued and not be resumed if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. Patients with a prior DRESS reaction with either oxcarbazepine or APTIOM should not be treated with APTIOM [see Contraindications (  4  )].  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Anaphylactic Reactions and Angioedema\n\n\n\n  Rare cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported in patients taking APTIOM. Anaphylaxis and angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If a patient develops any of these reactions after treatment with APTIOM, the drug should be discontinued. Patients with a prior anaphylactic-type reaction with either oxcarbazepine or APTIOM should not be treated with APTIOM [see Contraindications (  4  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Hyponatremia\n\n\n\n  Clinically significant hyponatremia (sodium <125 mEq/L) can develop in patients taking APTIOM. In the controlled adjunctive epilepsy trials, 4/415 patients (1.0%) treated with 800 mg and 6/410 (1.5%) patients treated with 1200 mg of APTIOM had at least one serum sodium value less than 125 mEq/L, compared to none of the patients assigned to placebo. A higher percentage of APTIOM-treated patients (5.1%) than placebo-treated patients (0.7%) experienced decreases in sodium values of more than 10 mEq/L. These effects were dose-related and generally appeared within the first 8 weeks of treatment (as early as after 3 days). Serious, life-threatening complications were reported with APTIOM-associated hyponatremia (as low as 112 mEq/L) including seizures, severe nausea/vomiting leading to dehydration, severe gait instability, and injury. Some patients required hospitalization and discontinuation of APTIOM. Concurrent hypochloremia was also present in patients with hyponatremia. Depending on the severity of hyponatremia, the dose of APTIOM may need to be reduced or discontinued. Hyponatremia was also observed in monotherapy trials.\n\n\n\n Measurement of serum sodium and chloride levels should be considered during maintenance treatment with APTIOM, particularly if the patient is receiving other medications known to decrease serum sodium levels and should be performed if symptoms of hyponatremia develop (e.g., nausea/vomiting, malaise, headache, lethargy, confusion, irritability, muscle weakness/spasms, obtundation, or increase in seizure frequency or severity).\n\n\n\n    5.6 Neurological Adverse Reactions\n\n\n\n   Dizziness and Disturbance in Gait and Coordination  \n\n\n\n APTIOM causes dose-related increases in adverse reactions related to dizziness and disturbance in gait and coordination (dizziness, ataxia, vertigo, balance disorder, gait disturbance, nystagmus, and abnormal coordination) [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . In controlled adjunctive epilepsy trials, these events were reported in 26% and 38% of patients randomized to receive APTIOM at doses of 800 mg and 1200 mg/day, respectively, compared to 12% of placebo-treated patients. Events related to dizziness and disturbance in gait and coordination were more often serious in APTIOM-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients (2% vs. 0%), and more often led to study withdrawal in APTIOM-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients (9% vs. 0.7%). There was an increased risk of these adverse reactions during the titration period (compared to the maintenance period) and there also may be an increased risk of these adverse reactions in patients 60 years of age and older compared to younger adults. Nausea and vomiting also occurred with these events. Dizziness and disturbance in gait and coordination were also observed in monotherapy trials.\n\n\n\n The incidence of dizziness was greater with the concomitant use of APTIOM and carbamazepine compared to the use of APTIOM without carbamazepine (up to 37% vs. 19%, respectively). Therefore, consider dosage modifications of both APTIOM and carbamazepine if these drugs are used concomitantly [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )].  \n\n\n\n    Somnolence and Fatigue  \n\n\n\n APTIOM causes dose-dependent increases in somnolence and fatigue-related adverse reactions (fatigue, asthenia, malaise, hypersomnia, sedation, and lethargy). In the controlled adjunctive epilepsy trials, these events were reported in 13% of placebo patients, 16% of patients randomized to receive 800 mg/day APTIOM, and 28% of patients randomized to receive 1200 mg/day APTIOM. Somnolence and fatigue-related events were serious in 0.3% of APTIOM-treated patients (and 0 placebo patients) and led to discontinuation in 3% of APTIOM-treated patients (and 0.7% of placebo-treated patients). Somnolence and fatigue were also observed in monotherapy trials.\n\n\n\n    Cognitive Dysfunction  \n\n\n\n APTIOM causes dose-dependent increases in cognitive dysfunction-related events (memory impairment, disturbance in attention, amnesia, confusional state, aphasia, speech disorder, slowness of thought, disorientation, and psychomotor retardation). In the controlled adjunctive epilepsy trials, these events were reported in 1% of placebo patients, 4% of patients randomized to receive 800 mg/day APTIOM, and 7% of patients randomized to receive 1200 mg/day APTIOM. Cognitive dysfunction-related events were serious in 0.2% of APTIOM-treated patients (and 0.2% of placebo patients) and led to discontinuation in 1% of APTIOM-treated patients (and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients). Cognitive dysfunction events were also observed in monotherapy trials.\n\n\n\n    Visual Changes  \n\n\n\n APTIOM causes dose-dependent increases in events related to visual changes including diplopia, blurred vision, and impaired vision. In the controlled adjunctive epilepsy trials, these events were reported in 16% of patients randomized to receive APTIOM compared to 6% of placebo patients. Eye events were serious in 0.7% of APTIOM-treated patients (and 0 placebo patients) and led to discontinuation in 4% of APTIOM-treated patients (and 0.2% of placebo-treated patients). There was an increased risk of these adverse reactions during the titration period (compared to the maintenance period) and also in patients 60 years of age and older (compared to younger adults). The incidence of diplopia was greater with the concomitant use of APTIOM and carbamazepine compared to the use of APTIOM without carbamazepine (up to 16% vs. 6%, respectively) [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  . Events related to visual changes were also observed in monotherapy trials.\n\n\n\n    Hazardous Activities  \n\n\n\n Prescribers should advise patients against engaging in hazardous activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating motor vehicles or dangerous machinery, until the effect of APTIOM is known.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Withdrawal of AEDs\n\n\n\n  As with all antiepileptic drugs, APTIOM should be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Drug Induced Liver Injury\n\n\n\n  Hepatic effects, ranging from mild to moderate elevations in transaminases (>3 times the upper limit of normal) to rare cases with concomitant elevations of total bilirubin (>2 times the upper limit of normal) have been reported with APTIOM use. Baseline evaluations of liver laboratory tests are recommended. The combination of transaminase elevations and elevated bilirubin without evidence of obstruction is generally recognized as an important predictor of severe liver injury. APTIOM should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or other evidence of significant liver injury (e.g., laboratory evidence).\n\n\n\n    5.9 Abnormal Thyroid Function Tests\n\n\n\n  Dose-dependent decreases in serum T3 and T4 (free and total) values have been observed in patients taking APTIOM. These changes were not associated with other abnormal thyroid function tests suggesting hypothyroidism. Abnormal thyroid function tests should be clinically evaluated.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Women taking DUAVEE should not take progestins, additional estrogens or additional estrogen agonist/antagonists (  5.1  ) \n *  Cardiovascular disorders, including venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, stroke, and retinal vascular thrombosis (  5.2  ,  5.6  ) \n *  Malignant neoplasms, including endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer (  5.3  ) \n *  Estrogens increase the risk of gallbladder disease (  5.5  ) \n *  Discontinue estrogen if loss of vision, severe hypertriglyceridemia or cholestatic jaundice occurs (  5.6  ,  5.8  ,  5.9  ) \n *  Monitor thyroid function in women on thyroid replacement therapy (  5.10  ,  5.17  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Drugs Containing Progestins, Estrogens or Estrogen Agonist/Antagonists\n\n\n\n  DUAVEE contains conjugated estrogens and bazedoxifene, an estrogen agonist/antagonist. Women taking DUAVEE should not take progestins, additional estrogens or additional estrogen agonist/antagonists.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Cardiovascular Disorders\n\n\n\n  Estrogen agonist/antagonists (including bazedoxifene, a component of DUAVEE) and estrogens individually are known to increase the risk of VTE.\n\n\n\n An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been reported with estrogen-alone therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, DUAVEE should be discontinued immediately.\n\n\n\n Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or VTE (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately.\n\n\n\n    Stroke  \n\n\n\n In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily conjugated estrogens (CE) (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted [see  Clinical Studies (14.5)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years).\n\n\n\n Should a stroke occur or be suspected, DUAVEE should be discontinued immediately [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  \n\n\n\n    Coronary Heart Disease  \n\n\n\n In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction, silent myocardial infarction, or CHD death) was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo [see  Clinical Studies (14.5)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest a statistically non-significant reduction in CHD events (CE [0.625 mg]-alone compared to placebo) in women with less than 10 years since menopause (8 versus 16 per 10,000 women-years).\n\n\n\n    Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)  \n\n\n\n In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE [DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE)] was increased for women receiving daily conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years [see  Clinical Studies (14.5)  ]  .\n\n\n\n If feasible, DUAVEE should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. Because immobilization increases the risk for venous thromboembolic events independent of therapy, DUAVEE should be discontinued prior to and during prolonged immobilization (e.g., post-surgical recovery, prolonged bed rest) and DUAVEE therapy should be resumed only after the patient is fully ambulatory. In addition, women taking DUAVEE should be advised to move about periodically during travel involving prolonged immobilization.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Malignant Neoplasms\n\n\n\n   Endometrial Cancer  \n\n\n\n An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more of treatment. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.\n\n\n\n DUAVEE contains an estrogen agonist/antagonist. This component reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia that can occur with the conjugated estrogens component. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Women taking DUAVEE should not take additional estrogens as this may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia.\n\n\n\n Clinical surveillance of all women taking DUAVEE is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.\n\n\n\n    Breast Cancer  \n\n\n\n The most important randomized clinical study providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily conjugated estrogen (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer (relative risk [RR] 0.80).\n\n\n\n The use of estrogen-alone has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. The effect of treatment with DUAVEE on the risk of breast cancer is unknown.\n\n\n\n All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.\n\n\n\n    Ovarian Cancer  \n\n\n\n In some epidemiological studies, the use of estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies, and some report no association. The effect of treatment with DUAVEE on the risk of ovarian cancer is unknown.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Probable Dementia\n\n\n\n  In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo.\n\n\n\n After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83-2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.5)  and  Clinical Studies (14.6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Gallbladder Disease\n\n\n\n  A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Visual Abnormalities\n\n\n\n  Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens. Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, DUAVEE should be permanently discontinued.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Elevated Blood Pressure\n\n\n\n  In a small number of case reports in women receiving estrogens, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Hypertriglyceridemia\n\n\n\n  In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, treatment with estrogens may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of DUAVEE if pancreatitis occurs.\n\n\n\n    5.9 Hepatic Impairment and Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice\n\n\n\n  DUAVEE has not been studied in women with impaired liver function or past history of cholestatic jaundice.\n\n\n\n Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function.\n\n\n\n On average, women with hepatic impairment treated with bazedoxifene alone showed a 4.3-fold increase in overall exposures compared with controls [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised; and in the case of recurrence, DUAVEE should be discontinued. Use of DUAVEE in patients with hepatic impairment is contraindicated [see  Contraindications (4)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.10 Hypothyroidism\n\n\n\n  Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.\n\n\n\n    5.11 Fluid Retention\n\n\n\n  Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention. Because of this, patients who have conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac dysfunction or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed. Use of DUAVEE in patients with renal impairment is not recommended [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.12 Hypocalcemia\n\n\n\n  Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.\n\n\n\n    5.13 Hereditary Angioedema\n\n\n\n  Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema.\n\n\n\n    5.14 Exacerbation of Other Conditions\n\n\n\n  Estrogens may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine or porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.\n\n\n\n    5.15 Premenopausal Women\n\n\n\n  There is no indication for premenopausal use of DUAVEE. The efficacy and safety of DUAVEE in premenopausal women have not been established, and its use is not recommended.\n\n\n\n    5.16 Laboratory Tests\n\n\n\n  Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.\n\n\n\n    5.17 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions\n\n\n\n  Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity.\n\n\n\n Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay), or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay. T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone.\n\n\n\n Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin).\n\n\n\n Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations, increased triglyceride levels.\n\n\n\n Impaired glucose tolerance.\n",

In patients with a history of transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver function tests should be considered. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be closely monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Dosing should be interrupted in patients with ALT or AST of greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Following resolution of transaminase elevations, consider the benefits and risks of resuming KALYDECO dosing. (  5.1  ,  6  ) \n *  Use with CYP3A inducers: Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) substantially decreases exposure of ivacaftor, which may diminish effectiveness. Therefore, co-administration is not recommended. (  5.2  ,  7.2  ,  12.3  ) \n *  Cataracts: Non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts have been reported in pediatric patients treated with KALYDECO. Baseline and follow-up examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating KALYDECO treatment. (  5.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Transaminase (ALT or AST) Elevations\n\n\n\n   Elevated transaminases have been reported in patients with CF receiving KALYDECO. It is recommended that ALT and AST be assessed prior to initiating KALYDECO, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver function tests should be considered. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be closely monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Dosing should be interrupted in patients with ALT or AST of greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Following resolution of transaminase elevations, consider the benefits and risks of resuming KALYDECO dosing [see   Adverse Reactions (6)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)    ] .    \n\n\n\n    5.2 Concomitant Use with CYP3A Inducers\n\n\n\n  Use of KALYDECO with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, substantially decreases the exposure of ivacaftor, which may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness of KALYDECO. Therefore, co-administration of KALYDECO with strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) is not recommended [ see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.3 Cataracts\n\n\n\n   Cases of non-congenital lens opacities/cataracts have been reported in pediatric patients treated with KALYDECO. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use and/or exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to KALYDECO cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in pediatric patients initiating KALYDECO treatment.  \n",

Ensure safe handling to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure (  2.1  ,  5.2  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Risk for Image Misinterpretation and other Errors\n\n\n\n  Errors may occur in the Amyvid estimation of brain neuritic plaque density during image interpretation [see Clinical Studies (  14  )]  .\n\n\n\n Image interpretation should be performed independently of the patient's clinical information. The use of clinical information in the interpretation of Amyvid images has not been evaluated and may lead to errors. Other errors may be due to extensive brain atrophy that limits the ability to distinguish gray and white matter on the Amyvid scan as well as motion artifacts that distort the image.\n\n\n\n Amyvid scan results are indicative of the brain neuritic amyloid plaque content only at the time of image acquisition and a negative scan result does not preclude the development of brain amyloid in the future.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Radiation Risk\n\n\n\n  Amyvid, similar to other radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )]  .\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including liver injury, have been reported. Discontinue TIVICAY and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop, as a delay in stopping treatment may result in a life-threatening reaction. (  5.1  ) \n *    Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations with use of TIVICAY. Appropriate laboratory testing prior to initiating therapy and monitoring for hepatotoxicity during therapy with TIVICAY is recommended in patients with underlying hepatic disease such as hepatitis B or C. (  5.2  ) \n *    Redistribution/accumulation of body fat and immune reconstitution syndrome have been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. (  5.3  ,  5.4  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including liver injury. The events were reported in less than 1% of subjects receiving TIVICAY in Phase 3 clinical trials. Discontinue TIVICAY and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters or peeling of the skin, oral blisters or lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema, difficulty breathing). Clinical status, including liver aminotransferases, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping treatment with TIVICAY or other suspect agents after the onset of hypersensitivity may result in a life-threatening reaction. TIVICAY is contraindicated in patients who have experienced a previous hypersensitivity reaction to dolutegravir.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Effects on Serum Liver Biochemistries in Patients with Hepatitis B or C Co-infection\n\n\n\n  Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations with use of TIVICAY [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  . In some cases the elevations in transaminases were consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome or hepatitis B reactivation particularly in the setting where anti-hepatitis therapy was withdrawn. Appropriate laboratory testing prior to initiating therapy and monitoring for hepatotoxicity during therapy with TIVICAY are recommended in patients with underlying hepatic disease such as hepatitis B or C.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Fat Redistribution\n\n\n\n  Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including TIVICAY. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.\n\n\n\n Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *   Thyroid C-cell Tumors: See Boxed Warning (  5.1  ). \n *   Pancreatitis: Has been reported in clinical trials. Discontinue promptly if pancreatitis is suspected. Do not restart if pancreatitis is confirmed. Consider other antidiabetic therapies in patients with history of pancreatitis (  5.2  ). \n *   Hypoglycemia: When TRULICITY is used with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., a sulfonylurea) or insulin, consider lowering the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia (  5.3  ). \n *   Hypersensitivity Reactions: Discontinue TRULICITY if suspected. Monitor and treat promptly per standard of care until signs and symptoms resolve (  5.4  ). \n *   Renal Impairment: Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions (  5.5  ). \n *   Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with TRULICITY or any other antidiabetic drug (  5.7  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors\n\n\n\n     In male and female rats, dulaglutide causes a dose-related and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) after lifetime exposure [see Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.1  )]  . Glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor agonists have induced thyroid C-cell adenomas and carcinomas in mice and rats at clinically relevant exposures. It is unknown whether TRULICITY will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of dulaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.\n\n\n\n    One case of MTC was reported in a patient treated with TRULICITY. This patient had pretreatment calcitonin levels approximately 8 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.\n\n\n\n    TRULICITY is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of TRULICITY and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g. a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).\n\n\n\n    Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with TRULICITY. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin value may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Pancreatitis\n\n\n\n  In Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies, 12 (3.4 cases per 1000 patient years) pancreatitis related adverse reactions were reported in patients exposed to TRULICITY versus 3 in non-incretin comparators (2.7 cases per 1000 patient years). An analyses of adjudicated events revealed 5 cases of confirmed pancreatitis in patients exposed to TRULICITY (1.4 cases per 1000 patient years) versus 1 case in non-incretin comparators (0.88 cases per 1000 patient years).\n\n\n\n After initiation of TRULICITY, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis, including persistent severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue TRULICITY. If pancreatitis is confirmed, TRULICITY should not be restarted. TRULICITY has not been evaluated in patients with a prior history of pancreatitis. Consider other antidiabetic therapies in patients with a history of pancreatitis.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin\n\n\n\n  The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when TRULICITY is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) or insulin. Patients may require a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in this setting [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Systemic hypersensitivity reactions were observed in patients receiving TRULICITY in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the patient should discontinue TRULICITY and promptly seek medical advice.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Renal Impairment\n\n\n\n  In patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, there have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis. Some of these events were reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration. Because these reactions may worsen renal function, use caution when initiating or escalating doses of TRULICITY in patients with renal impairment. Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.7  )].  \n\n\n\n    5.6 Severe Gastrointestinal Disease\n\n\n\n  Use of TRULICITY may be associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . TRULICITY has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe gastroparesis, and is therefore not recommended in these patients.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\n\n\n  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with TRULICITY or any other antidiabetic drug.\n",

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported with beta-lactam antibacterial drugs, including Teflaro. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Teflaro. (  5.1  ) \n *   Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including Teflaro. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (  5.2  ) \n *  Direct Coombs' test seroconversion has been reported with Teflaro. If anemia develops during or after therapy, a diagnostic workup for drug-induced hemolytic anemia should be performed and consideration given to discontinuation of Teflaro. (  5.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions and serious skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Before therapy with Teflaro is instituted, careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to other cephalosporins, penicillins, or carbapenems should be made. Maintain clinical supervision if this product is to be given to a penicillin- or other beta-lactam-allergic patient, because cross sensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial agents has been clearly established.\n\n\n\n If an allergic reaction to Teflaro occurs, discontinue Teflaro and institute appropriate treatment and supportive measures.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea\n\n\n\n   Clostridium difficile  -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including Teflaro, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.\n\n\n\n Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile  .\n\n\n\n  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.\n\n\n\n If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterials not directed against C. difficile  should be discontinued, if possible. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Direct Coombs' Test Seroconversion\n\n\n\n  Seroconversion from a negative to a positive direct Coombs' test result occurred in 120/1114 (10.8%) of patients receiving Teflaro and 49/1116 (4.4%) of patients receiving comparator drugs in the four pooled Phase 3 trials.\n\n\n\n In the pooled Phase 3 CABP trials, 51/520 (9.8%) of Teflaro-treated patients compared to 24/534 (4.5%) of ceftriaxone-treated patients seroconverted from a negative to a positive direct Coombs' test result. No adverse reactions representing hemolytic anemia were reported in any treatment group.\n\n\n\n If anemia develops during or after treatment with Teflaro, drug-induced hemolytic anemia should be considered. Diagnostic studies including a direct Coombs' test, should be performed. If drug-induced hemolytic anemia is suspected, discontinuation of Teflaro should be considered and supportive care should be administered to the patient (i.e. transfusion) if clinically indicated.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria\n\n\n\n  Prescribing Teflaro in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.\n",

Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy. (  5.1  ) \n *   Impairment in renal function: Monitor renal function during therapy. More frequent monitoring is recommended in patients with eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  (  5.2  ) \n *   Hypoglycemia: Consider lowering the dose of insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when initiating JARDIANCE (  5.3  ) \n *   Genital mycotic infections: Monitor and treat as appropriate (  5.4  ) \n *   Urinary tract infections: Monitor and treat as appropriate (  5.5  ) \n *   Increased LDL-C: Monitor and treat as appropriate (  5.6  ) \n *   Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with JARDIANCE (  5.7  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hypotension\n\n\n\n  JARDIANCE causes intravascular volume contraction. Symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating JARDIANCE [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  particularly in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Before initiating JARDIANCE, assess for volume contraction and correct volume status if indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy and increase monitoring in clinical situations where volume contraction is expected [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Impairment in Renal Function\n\n\n\n  JARDIANCE increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . The risk of impaired renal function with JARDIANCE is increased in elderly patients and patients with moderate renal impairment. More frequent monitoring of renal function is recommended in these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ,  8.6  )]  . Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiating JARDIANCE and periodically thereafter.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\n\n\n  Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when JARDIANCE is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Therefore, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with JARDIANCE.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Genital Mycotic Infections\n\n\n\n  JARDIANCE increases the risk for genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop mycotic genital infections. Monitor and treat as appropriate.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Urinary Tract Infections\n\n\n\n  JARDIANCE increases the risk for urinary tract infections [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Monitor and treat as appropriate.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Increased Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)\n\n\n\n  Increases in LDL-C can occur with JARDIANCE [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Monitor and treat as appropriate.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\n\n\n  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with JARDIANCE or any other antidiabetic drug.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *     Gout Flare : An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including ULORIC. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, ULORIC need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months. (  2.4  ,  5.1  ) \n *     Cardiovascular Events : A higher rate of cardiovascular thromboembolic events was observed in patients treated with ULORIC than allopurinol in clinical trials. Monitor for signs and symptoms of MI and stroke. (  5.2  ) \n *     Hepatic Effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt ULORIC and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart ULORIC if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. (  5.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Gout Flare\n\n\n\n  After initiation of ULORIC, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits.\n\n\n\n In order to prevent gout flares when ULORIC is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Cardiovascular Events\n\n\n\n  In the randomized controlled studies, there was a higher rate of cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) in patients treated with ULORIC (0.74 per 100 P-Y [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.36-1.37]) than allopurinol (0.60 per 100 P-Y [95% CI 0.16-1.53]) [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . A causal relationship with ULORIC has not been established. Monitor for signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Hepatic Effects\n\n\n\n   There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking ULORIC, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in ULORIC and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see        Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)   ]     .  \n\n\n\n  Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating ULORIC.  \n\n\n\n  Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), ULORIC treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. ULORIC should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.  \n\n\n\n  Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury and should not be restarted on ULORIC. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with ULORIC can be used with caution.  \n",

Withhold Kyprolis and evaluate promptly. (  5.1  ) \n *    Acute Renal Failure: Monitor serum creatinine regularly (  5.2  ) \n *    Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Administer pre-treatment hydration. (  2.1  ) Monitor for TLS, including uric acid levels and treat promptly. (  5.3  ) \n *    Pulmonary Toxicity: including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, acute respiratory failure, and acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease: Withhold Kyprolis and evaluate promptly (  5.4  ) \n *    Pulmonary Hypertension: Withhold Kyprolis and evaluate (  5.5  ) \n *    Dyspnea: For severe or life threatening dyspnea, withhold Kyprolis and evaluate. (  5.6  ) \n *    Hypertension including hypertensive crisis: Monitor blood pressure regularly. If hypertension cannot be adequately controlled, a risk-benefit decision on continued Kyprolis therapy is needed. (  5.7  ) \n *    Venous Thrombosis: Thromboprophylaxis is recommended. (  5.8  ) \n *    Infusion Reactions: Pre-medicate with dexamethasone. (  2.1  ,  5.9  ) \n *    Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet counts; interrupt or reduce Kyprolis dosing as clinically indicated. (  2.4  ,  5.10  ) \n *    Hepatic Toxicity and Hepatic Failure: Monitor liver enzymes. Withhold Kyprolis if suspected. (  5.11  ) \n *    Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS). Monitor for signs and symptoms of TTP/HUS. Discontinue Kyprolis if suspected. (  5.12  ) \n *    Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Consider neuro-radiological imaging (MRI) for onset of visual or neurological symptoms; discontinue Kyprolis if suspected. (  5.13  ) \n *    Embryo-fetal Toxicity: Kyprolis can cause fetal harm. Females of reproductive potential should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated. (  5.14  ,  8.1  ) \n    \n \n\n    5.1 Cardiac Toxicities  \n\n\n\n   New onset or worsening of pre-existing cardiac failure (e.g., congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, decreased ejection fraction), restrictive cardiomyopathy, myocardial ischemia, and myocardial infarction including fatalities have occurred following administration of Kyprolis. In clinical studies with Kyprolis, these events typically occurred early in the course of Kyprolis therapy (< 5 cycles). Death due to cardiac arrest has occurred within a day of Kyprolis administration.  \n\n\n\n  Withhold Kyprolis for Grade 3 or 4 cardiac adverse events until recovery, and consider whether to restart Kyprolis at 1 dose level reduction based on a benefit/risk assessment [ see Dosage and Administration (  2  )  ].  \n\n\n\n  While adequate hydration is required prior to each dose in Cycle 1, all patients should also be monitored for evidence of volume overload, especially patients at risk for cardiac failure. Adjust total fluid intake as clinically appropriate in patients with baseline cardiac failure or who are at risk for cardiac failure [ see Dosage and Administration (  2  )  ].  \n\n\n\n  In patients >= 75 years of age, the risk of cardiac failure is increased. Patients with New York Heart Association Class III and IV heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, and conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by medications were not eligible for the clinical trials. These patients may be at greater risk for cardiac complications [ see Use in Specific Populations (  8  )  ].  \n\n\n\n     5.2 Acute Renal Failure  \n\n\n\n   Cases of acute renal failure have occurred in patients receiving Kyprolis. Renal insufficiency adverse events (renal impairment, acute renal failure, renal failure) have occurred with an incidence of approximately 8% in a randomized controlled trial. Acute renal failure was reported more frequently in patients with advanced relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who received Kyprolis monotherapy. This risk was greater in patients with a baseline reduced estimated creatinine clearance (calculated using Cockcroft and Gault equation). Monitor renal function with regular measurement of the serum creatinine and/or estimated creatinine clearance. Reduce or withhold dose as appropriate [ see Dosage and Administration (  2  )  ].  \n\n\n\n     5.3 Tumor Lysis Syndrome  \n\n\n\n   Cases of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), including fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients who received Kyprolis. Patients with multiple myeloma and a high tumor burden should be considered to be at greater risk for TLS. Ensure that patients are well hydrated before administration of Kyprolis in Cycle 1, and in subsequent cycles as needed [ see Dosage and Administration (  2  )  ]. Consider uric acid lowering drugs in patients at risk for TLS. Monitor for evidence of TLS during treatment and manage promptly including interruption of Kyprolis until TLS is resolved [ see Dosage and Administration (  2  )  ].  \n\n\n\n     5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity  \n\n\n\n   Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, and acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease such as pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease have occurred in less than 1% of patients receiving Kyprolis. Some events have been fatal. In the event of drug-induced pulmonary toxicity, discontinue Kyprolis [ see Dosage and Administration (  2  )  ].  \n\n\n\n     5.5 Pulmonary Hypertension  \n\n\n\n   Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was reported in approximately 1% of patients treated with Kyprolis and was Grade 3 or greater in less than 1% of patients. Evaluate with cardiac imaging and/or other tests as indicated. Withhold Kyprolis for pulmonary hypertension until resolved or returned to baseline and consider whether to restart Kyprolis based on a benefit/risk assessment [ see Dosage and Administration (  2  )  ].  \n\n\n\n     5.6 Dyspnea  \n\n\n\n   Dyspnea was reported in 28% of patients treated with Kyprolis and was Grade 3 or greater in 4% of patients. Evaluate dyspnea to exclude cardiopulmonary conditions including cardiac failure and pulmonary syndromes. Stop Kyprolis for Grade 3 or 4 dyspnea until resolved or returned to baseline. Consider whether to restart Kyprolis based on a benefit/risk assessment [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  ), Warnings and Precautions - Cardiac Toxicities (  5.1  ), Pulmonary Toxicity (        5.4        ), and Adverse Reactions (  6  )  ].  \n\n\n\n     5.7 Hypertension  \n\n\n\n   Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis and hypertensive emergency, has been observed with Kyprolis. Some of these events have been fatal. Monitor blood pressure regularly in all patients. If hypertension cannot be adequately controlled, withhold Kyprolis and evaluate. Consider whether to restart Kyprolis based on a benefit/risk assessment [ see Dosage and Administration (  2  )  ].  \n\n\n\n     5.8 Venous Thrombosis  \n\n\n\n   Venous thromboembolic events (including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) have been observed with Kyprolis. In the combination study, the incidence of venous thromboembolic events in the first 12 cycles was 13% in the Kyprolis combination arm versus 6% in the control arm. With Kyprolis monotherapy, the incidence of venous thromboembolic events was 2%. Thromboprophylaxis is recommended and should be based on an assessment of the patient's underlying risks, treatment regimen, and clinical status.  \n\n\n\n     5.9 Infusion Reactions  \n\n\n\n   Infusion reactions, including life-threatening reactions, have occurred in patients receiving Kyprolis. Symptoms include fever, chills, arthralgia, myalgia, facial flushing, facial edema, vomiting, weakness, shortness of breath, hypotension, syncope, chest tightness, or angina. These reactions can occur immediately following or up to 24 hours after administration of Kyprolis. Administer dexamethasone prior to Kyprolis to reduce the incidence and severity of infusion reactions [ see Dosage and Administration (  2  )  ]. Inform patients of the risk and of symptoms and to contact a physician immediately if symptoms of an infusion reaction occur [ see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )  ].  \n\n\n\n     5.10 Thrombocytopenia  \n\n\n\n   Kyprolis causes thrombocytopenia with platelet nadirs observed between Day 8 and Day 15 of each 28-day cycle with recovery to baseline platelet count usually by the start of the next cycle [ see Adverse Reactions (  6  )  ]. Thrombocytopenia was reported in approximately 40% of patients in clinical trials with Kyprolis. Monitor platelet counts frequently during treatment with Kyprolis. Reduce or withhold dose as appropriate [ see Dosage and Administration (  2  )  ].  \n\n\n\n     5.11 Hepatic Toxicity and Hepatic Failure  \n\n\n\n   Cases of hepatic failure, including fatal cases, have been reported (< 1%) during treatment with Kyprolis. Kyprolis can cause increased serum transaminases. Monitor liver enzymes regularly. Reduce or withhold dose as appropriate [ see Dosage and Administration (  2  ) and Adverse Reactions (  6  )  ].  \n\n\n\n     5.12 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome  \n\n\n\n   Cases of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS) including fatal outcome have been reported in patients who received Kyprolis. Monitor for signs and symptoms of TTP/HUS. If the diagnosis is suspected, stop Kyprolis and evaluate. If the diagnosis of TTP/HUS is excluded, Kyprolis may be restarted. The safety of reinitiating Kyprolis therapy in patients previously experiencing TTP/HUS is not known.  \n\n\n\n     5.13 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)  \n\n\n\n   Cases of PRES have been reported in patients receiving Kyprolis. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), formerly termed Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), is a neurological disorder which can present with seizure, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, altered consciousness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, along with hypertension, and the diagnosis is confirmed by neuro-radiological imaging (MRI). Discontinue Kyprolis if PRES is suspected and evaluate. The safety of reinitiating Kyprolis therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not known.  \n\n\n\n     5.14 Embryo-fetal Toxicity  \n\n\n\n   Kyprolis can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using Kyprolis. Carfilzomib caused embryo-fetal toxicity in pregnant rabbits at doses that were lower than in patients receiving the recommended dose.  \n\n\n\n  Females of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with Kyprolis. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )  ].  \n",

[See  Boxed Warning  .]  \n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:   Immune-mediated adverse reactions: Permanently discontinue for severe reactions. Withhold dose for moderate immune-mediated adverse reactions until return to baseline, improvement to mild severity, or complete resolution, and patient is receiving less than 7.5 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. Administer systemic high-dose corticosteroids for severe, persistent, or recurring immune-mediated reactions.  (5.1  ,  5.2  ,  5.3  ,  5.4  ,  5.5)  \n\n\n\n *  ?  Immune-mediated hepatitis: Evaluate liver function tests before each dose of YERVOY.  (5.2)   \n *  ?  Immune-mediated endocrinopathies: Monitor thyroid function tests and clinical chemistries prior to each dose. Evaluate at each visit for signs and symptoms of endocrinopathy. Institute hormone replacement therapy as needed.  (5.5)   \n    \n \n\n   5.1   Immune-mediated Enterocolitis\n\n\n\n  In Study 1, severe, life-threatening, or fatal (diarrhea of 7 or more stools above baseline, fever, ileus, peritoneal signs; Grade 3-5) immune-mediated enterocolitis occurred in 34 (7%) YERVOY-treated patients, and moderate (diarrhea with up to 6 stools above baseline, abdominal pain, mucus or blood in stool; Grade 2) enterocolitis occurred in 28 (5%) YERVOY-treated patients. Across all YERVOY-treated patients (n=511), 5 (1%) patients developed intestinal perforation, 4 (0.8%) patients died as a result of complications, and 26 (5%) patients were hospitalized for severe enterocolitis.\n\n\n\n The median time to onset was 7.4 weeks (range: 1.6-13.4) and 6.3 weeks (range: 0.3-18.9) after the initiation of YERVOY for patients with Grade 3-5 enterocolitis and with Grade 2 enterocolitis, respectively.\n\n\n\n Twenty-nine patients (85%) with Grade 3-5 enterocolitis were treated with high-dose (>=40 mg prednisone equivalent per day) corticosteroids, with a median dose of 80 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; the median duration of treatment was 2.3 weeks (ranging up to 13.9 weeks) followed by corticosteroid taper. Of the 28 patients with moderate enterocolitis, 46% were not treated with systemic corticosteroids, 29% were treated with <40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day for a median duration of 5.1 weeks, and 25% were treated with high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days prior to corticosteroid taper. Infliximab was administered to 5 of the 62 patients (8%) with moderate, severe, or life-threatening immune-mediated enterocolitis following inadequate response to corticosteroids.\n\n\n\n Of the 34 patients with Grade 3-5 enterocolitis, 74% experienced complete resolution, 3% experienced improvement to Grade 2 severity, and 24% did not improve. Among the 28 patients with Grade 2 enterocolitis, 79% experienced complete resolution, 11% improved, and 11% did not improve.\n\n\n\n Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, mucus or blood in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus). In symptomatic patients, rule out infectious etiologies and consider endoscopic evaluation for persistent or severe symptoms.\n\n\n\n Permanently discontinue YERVOY in patients with severe enterocolitis and initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. In clinical trials, rapid corticosteroid tapering resulted in recurrence or worsening symptoms of enterocolitis in some patients.\n\n\n\n Withhold YERVOY dosing for moderate enterocolitis; administer anti-diarrheal treatment and, if persistent for more than 1 week, initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent. [See  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  .]  \n\n\n\n    5.2   Immune-mediated Hepatitis\n\n\n\n  In Study 1, severe, life-threatening, or fatal hepatotoxicity (AST or ALT elevations of more than 5 times the upper limit of normal or total bilirubin elevations more than 3 times the upper limit of normal; Grade 3-5) occurred in 8 (2%) YERVOY-treated patients, with fatal hepatic failure in 0.2% and hospitalization in 0.4% of YERVOY-treated patients. An additional 13 (2.5%) patients experienced moderate hepatotoxicity manifested by liver function test abnormalities (AST or ALT elevations of more than 2.5 times but not more than 5 times the upper limit of normal or total bilirubin elevation of more than 1.5 times but not more than 3 times the upper limit of normal; Grade 2). The underlying pathology was not ascertained in all patients but in some instances included immune-mediated hepatitis. There were insufficient numbers of patients with biopsy-proven hepatitis to characterize the clinical course of this event.\n\n\n\n Monitor liver function tests (hepatic transaminase and bilirubin levels) and assess patients for signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity before each dose of YERVOY. In patients with hepatotoxicity, rule out infectious or malignant causes and increase frequency of liver function test monitoring until resolution.\n\n\n\n Permanently discontinue YERVOY in patients with Grade 3-5 hepatotoxicity and administer systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent. When liver function tests show sustained improvement or return to baseline, initiate corticosteroid tapering and continue to taper over 1 month. Across the clinical development program for YERVOY, mycophenolate treatment has been administered in patients who have persistent severe hepatitis despite high-dose corticosteroids. Withhold YERVOY in patients with Grade 2 hepatotoxicity. [See  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  .]  \n\n\n\n    Concurrent Administration with Vemurafenib\n\n\n\n  In a dose-finding trial, Grade 3 increases in transaminases with or without concomitant increases in total bilirubin occurred in 6 of 10 patients who received concurrent YERVOY (3 mg/kg) and vemurafenib (960 mg BID or 720 mg BID).\n\n\n\n    5.3   Immune-mediated Dermatitis\n\n\n\n  In Study 1, severe, life-threatening, or fatal immune-mediated dermatitis (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or rash complicated by full thickness dermal ulceration, or necrotic, bullous, or hemorrhagic manifestations; Grade 3-5) occurred in 13 (2.5%) YERVOY-treated patients. One (0.2%) patient died as a result of toxic epidermal necrolysis and one additional patient required hospitalization for severe dermatitis. There were 63 (12%) patients with moderate (Grade 2) dermatitis.\n\n\n\n The median time to onset of moderate, severe, or life-threatening immune-mediated dermatitis was 3.1 weeks and ranged up to 17.3 weeks from the initiation of YERVOY.\n\n\n\n Seven (54%) YERVOY-treated patients with severe dermatitis received high-dose corticosteroids (median dose 60 mg prednisone/day or equivalent) for up to 14.9 weeks followed by corticosteroid taper. Of these 7 patients, 6 had complete resolution; time to resolution ranged up to 15.6 weeks.\n\n\n\n Of the 63 patients with moderate dermatitis, 25 (40%) were treated with systemic corticosteroids (median of 60 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) for a median of 2.1 weeks, 7 (11%) were treated with only topical corticosteroids, and 31 (49%) did not receive systemic or topical corticosteroids. Forty-four (70%) patients with moderate dermatitis were reported to have complete resolution, 7 (11%) improved to mild (Grade 1) severity, and 12 (19%) had no reported improvement.\n\n\n\n Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of dermatitis such as rash and pruritus. Unless an alternate etiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of dermatitis should be considered immune-mediated.\n\n\n\n Permanently discontinue YERVOY in patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or rash complicated by full thickness dermal ulceration, or necrotic, bullous, or hemorrhagic manifestations. Administer systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent. When dermatitis is controlled, corticosteroid tapering should occur over a period of at least 1 month. Withhold YERVOY dosing in patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms. [See  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  .]  \n\n\n\n For mild to moderate dermatitis, such as localized rash and pruritus, treat symptomatically. Administer topical or systemic corticosteroids if there is no improvement of symptoms within 1 week.\n\n\n\n    5.4   Immune-mediated Neuropathies\n\n\n\n  In Study 1, 1 case of fatal Guillain-Barre syndrome and 1 case of severe (Grade 3) peripheral motor neuropathy were reported. Across the clinical development program of YERVOY, myasthenia gravis and additional cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome have been reported.\n\n\n\n Monitor for symptoms of motor or sensory neuropathy such as unilateral or bilateral weakness, sensory alterations, or paresthesia. Permanently discontinue YERVOY in patients with severe neuropathy (interfering with daily activities) such as Guillain-Barre-like syndromes. Institute medical intervention as appropriate for management of severe neuropathy. Consider initiation of systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent for severe neuropathies. Withhold YERVOY dosing in patients with moderate neuropathy (not interfering with daily activities). [See  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  .]  \n\n\n\n    5.5   Immune-mediated Endocrinopathies\n\n\n\n  In Study 1, severe to life-threatening immune-mediated endocrinopathies (requiring hospitalization, urgent medical intervention, or interfering with activities of daily living; Grade 3-4) occurred in 9 (1.8%) YERVOY-treated patients. All 9 patients had hypopituitarism and some had additional concomitant endocrinopathies such as adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, and hypothyroidism. Six of the 9 patients were hospitalized for severe endocrinopathies. Moderate endocrinopathy (requiring hormone replacement or medical intervention; Grade 2) occurred in 12 (2.3%) patients and consisted of hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypopituitarism, and 1 case each of hyperthyroidism and Cushing's syndrome. The median time to onset of moderate to severe immune-mediated endocrinopathy was 11 weeks and ranged up to 19.3 weeks after the initiation of YERVOY.\n\n\n\n Of the 21 patients with moderate to life-threatening endocrinopathy, 17 patients required long-term hormone replacement therapy including, most commonly, adrenal hormones (n=10) and thyroid hormones (n=13).\n\n\n\n Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency (including adrenal crisis), and hyper- or hypothyroidism. Patients may present with fatigue, headache, mental status changes, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, and hypotension, or nonspecific symptoms which may resemble other causes such as brain metastasis or underlying disease. Unless an alternate etiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of endocrinopathies should be considered immune-mediated.\n\n\n\n Monitor thyroid function tests and clinical chemistries at the start of treatment, before each dose, and as clinically indicated based on symptoms. In a limited number of patients, hypophysitis was diagnosed by imaging studies through enlargement of the pituitary gland.\n\n\n\n Withhold YERVOY dosing in symptomatic patients. Initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent, and initiate appropriate hormone replacement therapy. [See  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  .]  \n\n\n\n    5.6   Other Immune-mediated Adverse Reactions, Including Ocular Manifestations\n\n\n\n  The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions were seen in less than 1% of YERVOY-treated patients in Study 1: nephritis, pneumonitis, meningitis, pericarditis, uveitis, iritis, and hemolytic anemia.\n\n\n\n Across the clinical development program for YERVOY, the following likely immune-mediated adverse reactions were also reported with less than 1% incidence: myocarditis, angiopathy, temporal arteritis, vasculitis, polymyalgia rheumatica, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, episcleritis, scleritis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, erythema multiforme, psoriasis, pancreatitis, arthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis, sarcoidosis, neurosensory hypoacusis, autoimmune central neuropathy (encephalitis), myositis, polymyositis, and ocular myositis.\n\n\n\n Permanently discontinue YERVOY for clinically significant or severe immune-mediated adverse reactions. Initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent for severe immune-mediated adverse reactions.\n\n\n\n Administer corticosteroid eye drops to patients who develop uveitis, iritis, or episcleritis. Permanently discontinue YERVOY for immune-mediated ocular disease that is unresponsive to local immunosuppressive therapy. [See  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  .]  \n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis has occurred in patients with impaired elimination of GBCAs. Higher than recommended dosing or repeated dosing appears to increase the risk (  5.1  ) \n *    Anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions with cardiovascular, respiratory or cutaneous manifestations, ranging from mild to severe, including death, have occurred. Monitor patients closely during and after administration of Gadavist (  5.2  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis\n\n\n\n  Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m  2  ) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. The risk appears lower for patients with chronic, moderate kidney disease (GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73m  2  ) and little, if any, for patients with chronic, mild kidney disease (GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m  2  ). NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs. Report any diagnosis of NSF following Gadavist administration to Bayer Healthcare (1-888-842-2937) or FDA (1-800-FDA-1088 or  www.fda.gov/medwatch  ).\n\n\n\n Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid (over hours to days) and usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly in the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced kidney toxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not reliably assess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example, age > 60 years, diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension), estimate the GFR through laboratory testing.\n\n\n\n Among the factors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA and degree of renal impairment at the time of exposure. Record the specific GBCA and the dose administered to a patient. For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended Gadavist dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug prior to re-administration. For patients receiving hemodialysis, consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration of a GBCA in order to enhance the contrast agent's elimination [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].  The usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions with cardiovascular, respiratory or cutaneous manifestations, ranging from mild to severe, including death, have uncommonly occurred following Gadavist administration [see Adverse Reactions (  6  )]  .\n\n\n\n *    Before Gadavist administration, assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media, bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to Gadavist. \n *    Administer Gadavist only in situations where trained personnel and therapies are promptly available for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, including personnel trained in resuscitation. \n    Most hypersensitivity reactions to Gadavist have occurred within half an hour after administration. Delayed reactions can occur up to several days after administration. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during and following Gadavist administration.\n \n\n    5.3 Acute Kidney Injury\n\n\n\n  In patients with chronic renal impairment, acute kidney injury sometimes requiring dialysis has been observed with the use of some GBCAs. Do not exceed the recommended dose; the risk of acute kidney injury may increase with higher than recommended doses.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions\n\n\n\n  Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of Gadavist. Extravasation into tissues during Gadavist administration may result in moderate irritation [see Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.2  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Overestimation of Extent of Malignant Disease in MRI of the Breast\n\n\n\n   Gadavist MRI of the breast overestimated the histologically confirmed extent of malignancy in the diseased breast in up to 50% of the patients [see Clinical Studies (    14.2   )].  \n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n     EXCERPT:    *   Depression : Advise patients, their caregivers, and families to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes and if such changes occur to contact their healthcare provider. Carefully weigh risks and benefits of treatment with OTEZLA in patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts or behavior. (5.1) \n *   Weight Decrease : Monitor weight regularly. If unexplained or clinically significant weight loss occurs, evaluate weight loss and consider discontinuation of OTEZLA (5.2) \n *   Drug Interactions : Use with strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is not recommended because loss of efficacy may occur (5.3,7.1) \n    \n   5.1 Depression\n\n  Treatment with OTEZLA is associated with an increase in adverse reactions of depression. Before using OTEZLA in patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts or behavior prescribers should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with OTEZLA in such patients. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and if such changes occur to contact their healthcare provider. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with OTEZLA if such events occur.\n\n\n\n   Psoriatic arthritis  : During the 0 to 16 week placebo-controlled period of the 3 controlled clinical trials, 1.0% (10/998) of subjects treated with OTEZLA reported depression or depressed mood compared to 0.8% (4/495) treated with placebo. During the clinical trials, 0.3% (4/1441) of subjects treated with OTEZLA discontinued treatment due to depression or depressed mood compared with none in placebo treated subjects (0/495). Depression was reported as serious in 0.2% (3/1441) of subjects exposed to OTEZLA, compared to none in placebo-treated subjects (0/495). Instances of suicidal ideation and behavior have been observed in 0.2% (3/1441) of subjects while receiving OTEZLA, compared to none in placebo treated subjects (0/495). In the clinical trials, 2 subjects who received placebo committed suicide compared to none in OTEZLA-treated subjects.\n\n\n\n   Psoriasis  : During the 0 to 16 week placebo-controlled period of the 3 controlled clinical trials, 1.3% (12/920) of subjects treated with OTEZLA reported depression compared to 0.4% (2/506) treated with placebo. During the clinical trials, 0.1% (1/1308) of subjects treated with OTEZLA discontinued treatment due to depression compared with none in placebo-treated subjects(0/506). Depression was reported as serious in 0.1% (1/1308) of subjects exposed to OTEZLA, compared to none in placebo-treated subjects (0/506). Instances of suicidal behavior have been observed in 0.1% (1/1308) of subjects while receiving OTEZLA, compared to 0.2% (1/506) in placebo-treated subjects. In the clinical trials, one subject treated with OTEZLA attempted suicide while one who received placebo committed suicide.\n\n\n\n   5.2 Weight Decrease\n\n  During the controlled period of the studies in psoriatic arthritis (PsA), weight decrease between 5%-10% of body weight was reported in 10% (49/497) of subjects treated with OTEZLA 30 mg twice daily compared to 3.3% (16/495) treated with placebo [  see Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].\n\n\n\n   During the controlled period of the trials in psoriasis, weight decrease between 5%-10% of body weight occurred in 12% (96/784) of subjects treated with OTEZLA compared to 5% (19/382) treated with placebo. Weight decrease of >=10% of body weight occurred in 2% (16/784) of subjects treated with OTEZLA 30 mg twice daily compared to 1% (3/382) subjects treated with placebo.  \n\n\n\n Patients treated with OTEZLA should have their weight monitored regularly. If unexplained or clinically significant weight loss occurs, weight loss should be evaluated, and discontinuation of OTEZLA should be considered.\n\n\n\n   5.3 Drug Interactions\n\n  Co-administration of strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducer, rifampin, resulted in a reduction of systemic exposure of apremilast, which may result in a loss of efficacy of OTEZLA. Therefore, the use of cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) with OTEZLA is not recommended [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  The potency Units of DYSPORT  (r)  are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of DYSPORT  (r)  cannot be compared to or converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products (5.1)  \n *  Recommended dose and frequency of administration should not be exceeded (5.4) \n *  Immediate medical attention may be required in cases of respiratory, speech or swallowing difficulties (5.3) \n *  Concomitant neuromuscular disorder may exacerbate clinical effects of treatment (5.5) \n *  DYSPORT   (r)   contains human albumin. There is a risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) however, no cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been identified for albumin (5.6) \n    \n   5.1 Lack of Interchangeability between Botulinum Toxin Products\n\n  The potency Units of DYSPORT  (r)  are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of DYSPORT  (r)  cannot be compared to or converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [  seeDescription (11)  ].\n\n\n\n   5.2 Spread of Toxin Effect\n\n  Post-marketing safety data from DYSPORT    (r)    and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death related to spread of toxin effects. The risk of the symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, and particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses, including spasticity in children and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than the maximum recommended total dose.\n\n\n\n   5.3 Dysphagia and Breathing Difficulties\n\n  Treatment with DYSPORT    (r)    and other botulinum toxin products can result in swallowing or breathing difficulties. Patients with pre- existing swallowing or breathing difficulties may be more susceptible to these complications. In most cases, this is a consequence of weakening of muscles in the area of injection that are involved in breathing or swallowing. When distant effects occur, additional respiratory muscles may be involved [  seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].\n\n\n\n Deaths as a complication of severe dysphagia have been reported after treatment with botulinum toxin. Dysphagia may persist for several weeks, and require use of a feeding tube to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration. Aspiration may result from severe dysphagia and is a particular risk when treating patients in whom swallowing or respiratory function is already compromised.\n\n\n\n Treatment of cervical dystonia with botulinum toxins may weaken neck muscles that serve as accessory muscles of ventilation. This may result in a critical loss of breathing capacity in patients with respiratory disorders who may have become dependent upon these accessory muscles. There have been post-marketing reports of serious breathing difficulties, including respiratory failure.\n\n\n\n Patients treated with botulinum toxin may require immediate medical attention should they develop problems with swallowing, speech or respiratory disorders. These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after injection with botulinum toxin [  seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2),Adverse Reactions (6.1),Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ].\n\n\n\n   5.4 Facial Anatomy in the Treatment of Glabellar Lines\n\n  Caution should be exercised when administering DYSPORT    (r)    to patients with surgical alterations to the facial anatomy, excessive weakness or atrophy in the target muscle(s), marked facial asymmetry, inflammation at the injection site(s), ptosis, excessive dermatochalasis, deep dermal scarring, thick sebaceous skin [  seeDosage and Administration (2.3  ] or the inability to substantially lessen glabellar lines by physically spreading them apart [  seeClinical Studies (14.2)  ].\n\n\n\n Do not exceed the recommended dosage and frequency of administration of DYSPORT    (r)    . In clinical trials, subjects who received a higher dose of DYSPORT    (r)    had an increased incidence of eyelid ptosis.\n\n\n\n   5.5 Pre-existing Neuromuscular Disorders\n\n  Individuals with peripheral motor neuropathic diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or neuromuscular junction disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome) should be monitored particularly closely when given botulinum toxin. Patients with neuromuscular disorders may be at increased risk of clinically significant effects including severe dysphagia and respiratory compromise from typical doses of DYSPORT    (r)    [  seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)  ].\n\n\n\n   5.6 Human Albumin\n\n  This product contains albumin, a derivative of human blood. Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries an extremely remote risk for transmission of viral diseases. A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is also considered extremely remote. No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been reported for albumin.\n\n\n\n   5.7 Intradermal Immune Reaction\n\n  The possibility of an immune reaction when injected intradermally is unknown. The safety of DYSPORT    (r)    for the treatment of hyperhidrosis has not been established. DYSPORT  (r)  is approved only for intramuscular injection .\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Hypotension: Before initiating INVOKANA, assess volume status and correct hypovolemia in patients with renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low systolic blood pressure, or if on diuretics, ACEi, or ARB. Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy (  5.1  ) \n *  Impairment in Renal Function: Monitor renal function during therapy. More frequent monitoring is recommended in patients with eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  (  5.2  ) \n *  Hyperkalemia: Monitor potassium levels in patients with impaired renal function and in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia (  2.2  ,  5.3  ,  6.1  ,  8.6  ) \n *  Hypoglycemia: Consider a lower dose of insulin or the insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with INVOKANA (  5.4  ) \n *  Genital mycotic infections: Monitor and treat if indicated (  5.5  ) \n *  Hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue INVOKANA and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve (  5.6  ) \n *  Bone fracture: Consider factors that contribute to fracture risk before initiating INVOKANA (  5.7  ) \n *  Increased LDL-C: Monitor LDL-C and treat if appropriate (  5.8  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hypotension\n\n\n\n  INVOKANA causes intravascular volume contraction. Symptomatic hypotension can occur after initiating INVOKANA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1  )]  particularly in patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  ), elderly patients, patients on either diuretics or medications that interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., angiotensin-converting-enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]), or patients with low systolic blood pressure. Before initiating INVOKANA in patients with one or more of these characteristics, volume status should be assessed and corrected. Monitor for signs and symptoms after initiating therapy.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Impairment in Renal Function\n\n\n\n  INVOKANA increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Patients with hypovolemia may be more susceptible to these changes. Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating INVOKANA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . More frequent renal function monitoring is recommended in patients with an eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m  2  .\n\n\n\n    5.3 Hyperkalemia\n\n\n\n  INVOKANA can lead to hyperkalemia. Patients with moderate renal impairment who are taking medications that interfere with potassium excretion, such as potassium-sparing diuretics, or medications that interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are at an increased risk of developing hyperkalemia [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Monitor serum potassium levels periodically after initiating INVOKANA in patients with impaired renal function and in patients predisposed to hyperkalemia due to medications or other medical conditions.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\n\n\n  Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. INVOKANA can increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with INVOKANA.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Genital Mycotic Infections\n\n\n\n  INVOKANA increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections and uncircumcised males were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor and treat appropriately.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., generalized urticaria), some serious, were reported with INVOKANA treatment; these reactions generally occurred within hours to days after initiating INVOKANA. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of INVOKANA; treat and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.7 Bone Fracture\n\n\n\n   An increased risk of bone fracture, occurring as early as 12 weeks after treatment initiation, was observed in patients using INVOKANA. Consider factors that contribute to fracture risk prior to initiating INVOKANA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.8 Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL-C)\n\n\n\n  Dose-related increases in LDL-C occur with INVOKANA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor LDL-C and treat if appropriate after initiating INVOKANA.\n\n\n\n    5.9 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\n\n\n  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with INVOKANA or any other antidiabetic drug.\n",

There is no clinical trial experience with XTANDI in patients who have had a seizure. Permanently discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop a seizure during treatment. (  5.1  )\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n   5.1 Seizure\n\n\n\n   In Study 1, which enrolled patients who previously received docetaxel, 7 of 800 (0.9%) patients treated with XTANDI experienced a seizure and no patients treated with placebo experienced a seizure. Seizure occurred from 31 to 603 days after initiation of XTANDI. In Study 2, 1 of 871 (0.1%) chemotherapy-naive patients treated with XTANDI and 1 of 844 (0.1%) patients treated with placebo experienced a seizure. Patients experiencing seizure were permanently discontinued from therapy and all seizure events resolved. There is no clinical trial experience re-administering XTANDI to patients who experienced seizure.  \n\n\n\n  Limited safety data are available in patients with predisposing factors for seizure because these patients were generally excluded from the trials. These exclusion criteria included a history of seizure, underlying brain injury with loss of consciousness, transient ischemic attack within the past 12 months, cerebral vascular accident, brain metastases, and brain arteriovenous malformation. Study 1 excluded the use of concomitant medications that may lower the seizure threshold, whereas Study 2 permitted the use of these medications.  \n\n\n\n  Because of the risk of seizure associated with XTANDI use, patients should be advised of the risk of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious harm to themselves or others. Permanently discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop a seizure during treatment.  \n",

Manage by dose reduction or discontinuation until symptoms resolve, and consider use of corticosteroids. (  5.1  ) \n *  Infections: Increased risk of infections, some fatal. Monitor for signs and symptoms, and treat promptly. (  5.2  ) \n *  Angioedema: Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. (  5.3  ) \n *  Oral ulceration: Mouth ulcers, stomatitis, and oral mucositis are common. Management includes mouthwashes and topical treatments. (  5.4  ) \n *  Renal failure: Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have been observed. (  5.5  ) \n *  Impaired wound healing: Increased risk of wound-related complications. Monitor signs and symptoms. Exercise caution in the peri-surgical period. (  5.6  ) \n *  Laboratory test alterations: Elevations of serum creatinine, urinary protein, blood glucose, and lipids may occur. Decreases in hemoglobin, neutrophils, and platelets may also occur. Monitor renal function, blood glucose, lipids, and hematologic parameters prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. (  5.8  ) \n *  Vaccinations: Avoid live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live vaccines. (  5.11  ) \n *  Embryo-fetal toxicity: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Apprise women of potential harm to the fetus. (  5.12  ,  8.1  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1     Non-infectious Pneumonitis\n\n\n\n  Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives, including AFINITOR. Non-infectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated with AFINITOR in clinical trials. The incidence of Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) Grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was up to 4.0% and up to 0.2%, respectively  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]  . Fatal outcomes have been observed.\n\n\n\n Consider a diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, pleural effusion, cough, or dyspnea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic, and other causes have been excluded by means of appropriate investigations. Opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Advise patients to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms.\n\n\n\n Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms may continue AFINITOR therapy without dose alteration. Imaging appears to overestimate the incidence of clinical pneumonitis.\n\n\n\n If symptoms are moderate, consider interrupting therapy until symptoms improve. The use of corticosteroids may be indicated. AFINITOR may be reintroduced at a daily dose approximately 50% lower than the dose previously administered [see Table 1 in Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  .\n\n\n\n For cases of Grade 3 non-infectious pneumonitis interrupt AFINITOR until resolution to less than or equal to Grade 1. AFINITOR may be re-introduced at a daily dose approximately 50% lower than the dose previously administered depending on the individual clinical circumstances [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  . If toxicity recurs at Grade 3, consider discontinuation of AFINITOR. For cases of Grade 4 non-infectious pneumonitis, discontinue AFINITOR. Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve. For patients who require use of corticosteroids for treatment of non-infectious pneumonitis, prophylaxis for PJP may be considered. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose.\n\n\n\n    5.2     Infections\n\n\n\n  AFINITOR has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]  . Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections, such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, or pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) and viral infections including reactivation of hepatitis B virus have occurred in patients taking AFINITOR. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g., leading to sepsis, respiratory or hepatic failure) or fatal. Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with AFINITOR. Complete treatment of pre-existing invasive fungal infections prior to starting treatment with AFINITOR. While taking AFINITOR, be vigilant for signs and symptoms of infection; if a diagnosis of an infection is made, institute appropriate treatment promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation of AFINITOR. If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, discontinue AFINITOR and treat with appropriate antifungal therapy.\n\n\n\n Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, some with a fatal outcome, has been reported in patients who received everolimus. This may be associated with concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents. Prophylaxis for PJP should be considered when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required.\n\n\n\n    5.3     Angioedema with Concomitant Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors\n\n\n\n   Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment). In a pooled analysis of randomized double-blind oncology clinical trials, the incidence of angioedema in patients taking everolimus with an ACE inhibitor was 6.8% compared to 1.3% in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor.  \n\n\n\n    5.4     Oral Ulceration\n\n\n\n  Mouth ulcers, stomatitis, and oral mucositis have occurred in patients treated with AFINITOR at an incidence ranging from 44%-78% across the clinical trial experience. Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis was reported in 4%-9% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]  . In such cases, topical treatments are recommended, but alcohol-, hydrogen peroxide-, iodine-, or thyme- containing mouthwashes should be avoided as they may exacerbate the condition. Antifungal agents should not be used unless fungal infection has been diagnosed [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5     Renal Failure\n\n\n\n  Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have been observed in patients treated with AFINITOR [see Laboratory Tests and Monitoring (5.8)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.6     Impaired Wound Healing\n\n\n\n  Everolimus delays wound healing and increases the occurrence of wound-related complications like wound dehiscence, wound infection, incisional hernia, lymphocele, and seroma. These wound-related complications may require surgical intervention. Exercise caution with the use of AFINITOR in the peri-surgical period.\n\n\n\n    5.7     Geriatric Patients\n\n\n\n  In the randomized advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer study, the incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last AFINITOR dose was 6% in patients >= 65 years of age compared to 2% in patients < 65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients >= 65 years of age compared to 17% in patients < 65 years of age. Careful monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments for adverse reactions are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.8     Laboratory Tests and Monitoring\n\n\n\n   Renal Function  \n\n\n\n Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking AFINITOR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]  . Monitoring of renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary protein, or serum creatinine, is recommended prior to the start of AFINITOR therapy and periodically thereafter. Renal function of patients should be monitored particularly where patients have additional risk factors that may further impair renal function.\n\n\n\n  Blood Glucose and Lipids  \n\n\n\n Hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported in patients taking AFINITOR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]  . Monitoring of fasting serum glucose and lipid profile is recommended prior to the start of AFINITOR therapy and periodically thereafter as well as management with appropriate medical therapy. More frequent monitoring is recommended when AFINITOR is co-administered with other drugs that may induce hyperglycemia. When possible, optimal glucose and lipid control should be achieved before starting a patient on AFINITOR.\n\n\n\n  Hematologic Parameters  \n\n\n\n Decreased hemoglobin, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets have been reported in patients taking AFINITOR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5)]  . Monitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to the start of AFINITOR therapy and periodically thereafter.\n\n\n\n    5.9     Drug-drug Interactions\n\n\n\n  Due to significant increases in exposure of everolimus, co-administration with strong CYP3A4/PgP inhibitors should be avoided  [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]  .\n\n\n\n A reduction of the AFINITOR dose is recommended when co-administered with a moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]  .\n\n\n\n An increase in the AFINITOR dose is recommended when co-administered with a strong CYP3A4/PgP inducer [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.5) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.10     Hepatic Impairment\n\n\n\n  Exposure to everolimus was increased in patients with hepatic impairment  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  .\n\n\n\n For advanced HR+ BC, advanced PNET, advanced RCC, and renal angiomyolipoma with TSC patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), AFINITOR may be used at a reduced dose if the desired benefit outweighs the risk. For patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment, a dose reduction is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  .\n\n\n\n For patients with SEGA and mild or moderate hepatic impairment, adjust the dose of AFINITOR Tablets or AFINITOR DISPERZ based on therapeutic drug monitoring. For patients with SEGA and severe hepatic impairment, reduce the starting dose of AFINITOR Tablets or AFINITOR DISPERZ by approximately 50% and adjust subsequent doses based on therapeutic drug monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.11     Vaccinations\n\n\n\n  During AFINITOR treatment, avoid the use of live vaccines and avoid close contact with individuals who have received live vaccines (e.g., intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines).\n\n\n\n For pediatric patients with SEGA that do not require immediate treatment, complete the recommended childhood series of live virus vaccinations according to American Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines prior to the start of therapy. An accelerated vaccination schedule may be appropriate.\n\n\n\n    5.12     Embryo-fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Based on the mechanism of action, AFINITOR can cause fetal harm. Everolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicities in animals at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]  .\n\n\n\n Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use highly effective contraception while using AFINITOR and for up to 8 weeks after ending treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]  .\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  A higher number of myocardial infarctions was reported in patients treated with alvimopan 0.5 mg twice daily compared with placebo in a 12-month study in patients treated with opioids for chronic non-cancer pain, although a causal relationship with long-term use has not been established. (5.1) \n *  Patients recently exposed to opioids are expected to be more sensitive to the effects of ENTEREG and therefore may experience abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea. (5.3) \n *  Not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. (5.4) \n *  Not recommended in patients with end-stage renal disease. (5.5) \n *  Not recommended in patients with complete gastrointestinal obstruction or in patients who have surgery for correction of complete bowel obstruction. (5.6) \n *  Not recommended in pancreatic or gastric anastomosis. (5.7) \n    \n   5.1 Potential Risk of Myocardial Infarction with Long-term Use\n\n  There were more reports of myocardial infarctions in patients treated with alvimopan 0.5 mg twice daily compared with placebo-treated patients in a 12-month study of patients treated with opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (alvimopan 0.5 mg, n = 538; placebo, n = 267). In this study, the majority of myocardial infarctions occurred between 1 and 4 months after initiation of treatment. This imbalance has not been observed in other studies of ENTEREG in patients treated with opioids for chronic pain, nor in patients treated within the surgical setting, including patients undergoing surgeries that included bowel resection who received ENTEREG 12 mg twice daily for up to 7 days (the indicated dose and patient population; ENTEREG 12 mg, n = 1,142; placebo, n = 1,120). A causal relationship with alvimopan with long-term use has not been established.\n\n\n\n ENTEREG is available only through a program under a REMS that restricts use to enrolled hospitals  [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2)].  \n\n\n\n   5.2 E.A.S.E. ENTEREG REMS Program\n\n  ENTEREG is available only through a program called the ENTEREG Access Support and Education (E.A.S.E.) ENTEREG REMS Program that restricts use to enrolled hospitals because of the potential risk of myocardial infarction with long-term use of ENTEREG  [seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1)].  \n\n\n\n Notable requirements of the E.A.S.E. Program include the following:\n\n\n\n ENTEREG is available only for short-term (15 doses) use in hospitalized patients. Only hospitals that have enrolled in and met all of the requirements for the E.A.S.E. program may use ENTEREG.\n\n\n\n To enroll in the E.A.S.E. Program, an authorized hospital representative must acknowledge that:\n\n\n\n *  hospital staff who prescribe, dispense, or administer ENTEREG have been provided the educational materials on the need to limit use of ENTEREG to short-term, inpatient use; \n *  patients will not receive more than 15 doses of ENTEREG; and \n *  ENTEREG will not be dispensed to patients after they have been discharged from the hospital. \n    Further information is available at www.ENTEREGREMS.com or 1-800-278-0340.\n \n\n   5.3 Gastrointestinal-Related Adverse Reactions in Opioid-Tolerant Patients\n\n  Patients recently exposed to opioids are expected to be more sensitive to the effects of mu-opioid receptor antagonists, such as ENTEREG. Since ENTEREG acts peripherally, clinical signs and symptoms of increased sensitivity would be related to the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea). Patients receiving more than 3 doses of an opioid within the week prior to surgery were not studied in the postoperative ileus clinical trials. Therefore, if ENTEREG is administered to these patients, they should be monitored for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. ENTEREG is contraindicated in patients who have taken therapeutic doses of opioids for more than 7 consecutive days immediately prior to taking ENTEREG.\n\n\n\n   5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment\n\n  Patients with severe hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of serious adverse reactions (including dose-related serious adverse reactions) because up to 10-fold higher plasma levels of drug have been observed in such patients compared with patients with normal hepatic function. Therefore, the use of ENTEREG is not recommended in this population.\n\n\n\n   5.5 End-Stage Renal Disease\n\n  No studies have been conducted in patients with end-stage renal disease. ENTEREG is not recommended for use in these patients.\n\n\n\n   5.6 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Patients with Complete Gastrointestinal Obstruction\n\n  No studies have been conducted in patients with complete gastrointestinal obstruction or in patients who have surgery for correction of complete bowel obstruction. ENTEREG is not recommended for use in these patients.\n\n\n\n   5.7 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Pancreatic and Gastric Anastomoses\n\n  ENTEREG has not been studied in patients having pancreatic or gastric anastomosis. Therefore, ENTEREG is not recommended for use in these patients.\n",

(5.1,12.6) \n *  Halofantrine and Coartem Tablets should not be administered within one month of each other due to potential additive effects on the QT interval. (5.1,5.2,12.3) \n *  Antimalarials should not be given concomitantly, unless there is no other treatment option, due to limited safety data. (5.2) \n *  QT prolonging drugs, including quinine and quinidine, should be used cautiously following Coartem Tablets. (5.1,5.2,7.7,12.3) \n *  Substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of CYP3A4, including antiretroviral medications, should be used cautiously with Coartem Tablets, due to a potential loss of efficacy of the concomitant drug or additive QT prolongation. (5.3,7.2,7.3) \n    \n   5.1     Prolongation of the QT Interval\n\n  Some antimalarials (e.g., halofantrine, quinine, quinidine) including Coartem Tablets have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram.\n\n\n\n Coartem Tablets should be avoided in patients:\n\n\n\n *  with congenital prolongation of the QT interval (e.g., long QT syndrome) or any other clinical condition known to prolong the QTc interval such as patients with a history of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias, with clinically relevant bradycardia or with severe cardiac disease. \n *  with a family history of congenital prolongation of the QT interval or sudden death. \n *  with known disturbances of electrolyte balance, e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. \n *  receiving other medications that prolong the QT interval, such as class IA (quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide), or class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents; antipsychotics (pimozide, ziprasidone); antidepressants; certain antibiotics (macrolide antibiotics, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)] . \n *  receiving medications that are metabolized by the cytochrome enzyme CYP2D6 which also have cardiac effects (e.g., flecainide, imipramine, amitriptyline, clomipramine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Drug Interactions (7.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . \n      5.2     Use of QT Prolonging Drugs and Other Antimalarials\n   Halofantrine and Coartem Tablets should not be administered within 1 month of each other due to the long elimination half-life of lumefantrine (3 to 6 days) and potential additive effects on the QT interval  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  .\n\n\n\n Antimalarials should not be given concomitantly with Coartem Tablets, unless there is no other treatment option, due to limited safety data.\n\n\n\n Drugs that prolong the QT interval, including antimalarials such as quinine and quinidine, should be used cautiously following Coartem Tablets, due to the long elimination half-life of lumefantrine (3 to 6 days) and the potential for additive effects on the QT interval; ECG monitoring is advised if use of drugs that prolong the QT interval is medically required  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.7),  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  .\n\n\n\n If mefloquine is administered immediately prior to Coartem Tablets there may be a decreased exposure to lumefantrine, possibly due to a mefloquine-induced decrease in bile production. Therefore, patients should be monitored for decreased efficacy and food consumption should be encouraged while taking Coartem Tablets  [see     Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7.4),  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  .\n\n\n\n   5.3     Drug Interactions with CYP3A4\n\n  When Coartem Tablets are coadministered with substrates of CYP3A4 it may result in decreased concentrations of the substrate and potential loss of substrate efficacy. When Coartem Tablets are coadministered with an inhibitor of CYP3A4, including grapefruit juice it may result in increased concentrations of artemether and/or lumefantrine and potentiate QT prolongation. When Coartem Tablets are coadministered with inducers of CYP3A4 it may result in decreased concentrations of artemether and/or lumefantrine and loss of antimalarial efficacy  [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]  .\n\n\n\n Drugs that have a mixed effect on CYP3A4, especially antiretroviral drugs such as HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and those that have an effect on the QT interval should be used with caution in patients taking Coartem Tablets  [see Drug Interactions (7.3, 7.7)]  .\n\n\n\n Coartem Tablets may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, patients using oral, transdermal patch, or other systemic hormonal contraceptives should be advised to use an additional non-hormonal method of birth control  [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]  .\n\n\n\n   5.4     Drug Interactions with CYP2D6\n\n  Administration of Coartem Tablets with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 may significantly increase plasma concentrations of the coadministered drug and increase the risk of adverse effects. Many of the drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can prolong the QT interval and should not be administered with Coartem Tablets due to the potential additive effect on the QT interval (e.g., flecainide, imipramine, amitriptyline, clomipramine)  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  .\n\n\n\n   5.5     Recrudescence\n\n  Food enhances absorption of artemether and lumefantrine following administration of Coartem Tablets. Patients who remain averse to food during treatment should be closely monitored as the risk of recrudescence may be greater  [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]  .\n\n\n\n In the event of recrudescent  P. falciparum  infection after treatment with Coartem Tablets, patients should be treated with a different antimalarial drug.\n\n\n\n   5.6     Hepatic and Renal Impairment\n\n  Coartem Tablets have not been studied for efficacy and safety in patients with severe hepatic and/or renal impairment  [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]  .\n\n\n\n   5.7       Plasmodium vivax  Infection\n\n  Coartem Tablets have been shown in limited data (43 patients) to be effective in treating the erythrocytic stage of  P. vivax  infection. However, relapsing malaria caused by  P. vivax  requires additional treatment with other antimalarial agents to achieve radical cure i.e., eradicate any hypnozoites forms that may remain dormant in the liver.\n",

(  5.1  ) \n *  Rapid intravenous infusion of glycopeptide antibacterial agents can cause reactions. (  5.2  ) \n *  ALT elevations with DALVANCE treatment were reported in clinical trials. (  5.3  ) \n *   Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including DALVANCE. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (  5.4  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) and skin reactions have been reported in patients treated with DALVANCE. If an allergic reaction occurs, treatment with DALVANCE should be discontinued. Before using DALVANCE, inquire carefully about previous hypersensitivity reactions to glycopeptides, and due to the possibility of cross-sensitivity, exercise caution in patients with a history of glycopeptide allergy [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions\n\n\n\n  DALVANCE is administered via intravenous infusion, using a total infusion time of 30 minutes to minimize the risk of infusion-related reactions. Rapid intravenous infusions of DALVANCE can cause reactions that resemble \"Red-Man Syndrome,\" including flushing of the upper body, urticaria, pruritus, and/or rash. Stopping or slowing the infusion may result in cessation of these reactions.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Hepatic Effects\n\n\n\n  In Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, more DALVANCE- than comparator-treated subjects with normal baseline transaminase levels had post-baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Overall, abnormalities in liver tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin) were reported with similar frequency in the DALVANCE and comparator arms [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea\n\n\n\n   Clostridium difficile  -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported in users of nearly all systemic antibacterial drugs, including DALVANCE, with severity ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents can alter the normal flora of the colon, and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile  .\n\n\n\n  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.\n\n\n\n If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile  should be discontinued, if possible. Appropriate measures such as fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria\n\n\n\n  Prescribing DALVANCE in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n     EXCERPT:    *  If infection occurs while on Ferriprox, interrupt therapy and monitor the ANC more frequently. (5.1) \n *  Ferriprox can cause fetal harm. Women should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid pregnancy while on this drug. (5.2) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Agranulocytosis/Neutropenia\n\n\n\n  Fatal agranulocytosis can occur with Ferriprox use. Ferriprox can also cause neutropenia, which may foreshadow agranulocytosis. Measure the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) before starting Ferriprox therapy and monitor the ANC weekly on therapy.\n\n\n\n Interrupt Ferriprox therapy if neutropenia develops (ANC < 1.5 x 10  9  /L).\n\n\n\n Interrupt Ferriprox if infection develops, and monitor the ANC more frequently.\n\n\n\n Advise patients taking Ferriprox to immediately interrupt therapy and report to their physician if they experience any symptoms indicative of infection.\n\n\n\n In pooled clinical trials, the incidence of agranulocytosis was 1.7% of patients. The mechanism of Ferriprox-associated agranulocytosis is unknown. Agranulocytosis and neutropenia usually resolve upon discontinuation of Ferriprox, but there have been reports of agranulocytosis leading to death.\n\n\n\n Implement a plan to monitor for and to manage agranulocytosis/neutropenia prior to initiating Ferriprox treatment.\n\n\n\n  For neutropenia (ANC < 1.5 x 10  9  /L and > 0.5 x 10  9  /L):  \n\n\n\n Instruct the patient to immediately discontinue Ferriprox and all other medications with a potential to cause neutropenia.\n\n\n\n Obtain a complete blood cell (CBC) count, including a white blood cell (WBC) count corrected for the presence of nucleated red blood cells, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and a platelet count daily until recovery (ANC >= 1.5 x 10  9  /L).   \n\n\n\n  For agranulocytosis (ANC < 0.5 x 10  9  /L):  \n\n\n\n    Consider hospitalization and other management as clinically appropriate.\n\n\n\n Do not resume Ferriprox in patients who have developed agranulocytosis unless potential benefits outweigh potential risks. Do not rechallenge patients who develop neutropenia with Ferriprox unless potential benefits outweigh potential risks.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Embryofetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Based on evidence of genotoxicity and developmental toxicity in animal studies, Ferriprox can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, administration of deferiprone during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death and malformations at doses lower than equivalent human clinical doses. If Ferriprox is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking Ferriprox, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy when taking Ferriprox [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  and  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  .   \n\n\n\n    5.3 Laboratory Tests\n\n\n\n   Serum Liver Enzyme Activities  \n\n\n\n    In clinical studies, 7.5% of 642 subjects treated with Ferriprox developed increased ALT values. Four (0.62%) Ferriprox-treated subjects discontinued the drug due to increased serum ALT levels and 1 (0.16%) due to an increase in both ALT and AST.\n\n\n\n Monitor serum ALT values monthly during therapy with Ferriprox, and consider interruption of therapy if there is a persistent increase in the serum transaminase levels.\n\n\n\n  Plasma Zinc Concentration  \n\n\n\n    Decreased plasma zinc concentrations have been observed on Ferriprox therapy. Monitor plasma zinc, and supplement in the event of a deficiency.\n",

        "section_text": "    5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Bleeding: PRADAXA can cause serious and fatal bleeding  (5.2)   \n *  Bioprosthetic heart valves: PRADAXA use not recommended  (5.4)   \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation\n\n\n\n  Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including PRADAXA, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. If PRADAXA is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration  (2.4  ,  2.5  ,  2.6)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Risk of Bleeding\n\n\n\n  PRADAXA increases the risk of bleeding and can cause significant and, sometimes, fatal bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss (e.g., a drop in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit or hypotension). Discontinue PRADAXA in patients with active pathological bleeding  [see Dosage and Administration  (2.2)  ]    .\n\n\n\n Risk factors for bleeding include the concomitant use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anti-platelet agents, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs). PRADAXA's anticoagulant activity and half-life are increased in patients with renal impairment  [see Clinical Pharmacology  (12.2)  ]    .\n\n\n\n  Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect:  A specific reversal agent for dabigatran is not available. Hemodialysis can remove dabigatran; however the clinical experience supporting the use of hemodialysis as a treatment for bleeding is limited [see Overdosage  (10)  ]  . Activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCCs, e.g., FEIBA), or recombinant Factor VIIa, or concentrates of coagulation factors II, IX or X may be considered but their use has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of dabigatran. Consider administration of platelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long-acting antiplatelet drugs have been used.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture\n\n\n\n  When neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural anesthesia) or spinal puncture is employed, patients treated with anticoagulant agents are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis [see  Boxed Warning  ]  .\n\n\n\n To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of dabigatran and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of dabigatran [see Clinical Pharmacology  (12.3)  ]  . Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.\n\n\n\n Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, monitor frequently to detect any signs or symptoms of neurological impairment, such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness, tingling, or weakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to immediately report if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Thromboembolic and Bleeding Events in Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves\n\n\n\n  The safety and efficacy of PRADAXA in patients with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic heart valves was evaluated in the RE-ALIGN trial, in which patients with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic heart valves (recently implanted or implanted more than three months prior to enrollment) were randomized to dose adjusted warfarin or 150, 220, or 300 mg of PRADAXA twice a day. RE-ALIGN was terminated early due to the occurrence of significantly more thromboembolic events (valve thrombosis, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and myocardial infarction) and an excess of major bleeding (predominantly post-operative pericardial effusions requiring intervention for hemodynamic compromise) in the PRADAXA treatment arm as compared to the warfarin treatment arm. These bleeding and thromboembolic events were seen both in patients who were initiated on PRADAXA post-operatively within three days of mechanical bileaflet valve implantation, as well as in patients whose valves had been implanted more than three months prior to enrollment. Therefore, the use of PRADAXA is contraindicated in patients with mechanical prosthetic valves [see Contraindications  (4)  ].  \n\n\n\n The use of PRADAXA for the prophylaxis of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation in the setting of other forms of valvular heart disease, including the presence of a bioprosthetic heart valve, has not been studied and is not recommended.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Effect of P-gp Inducers and Inhibitors on Dabigatran Exposure\n\n\n\n  The concomitant use of PRADAXA with P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin) reduces exposure to dabigatran and should generally be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology  (12.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n P-gp inhibition and impaired renal function are the major independent factors that result in increased exposure to dabigatran [see Clinical Pharmacology  (12.3)  ].  Concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors in patients with renal impairment is expected to produce increased exposure of dabigatran compared to that seen with either factor alone.\n\n\n\n   Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation    \n\n\n\n Reduce the dose of PRADAXA to 75 mg twice daily when dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole is coadministered with PRADAXA in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-50 mL/min). Avoid use of PRADAXA and P-gp inhibitors in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15-30 mL/min) [see Drug Interactions  (7.1)  and Use in Specific Populations  (8.6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n   Treatment and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism    \n\n\n\n Avoid use of PRADAXA and concomitant P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl <50 mL/min [see Drug Interactions  (7.2)  and Use in Specific Populations  (8.6)  ]  .\n",

(  5.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1     Serious Allergic Reactions\n\n\n\n  Serious allergic reactions occurred in less than 1% of patients [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.2     Monitoring Methotrexate Concentration/Interference with Assay\n\n\n\n  Methotrexate concentrations within 48 hours following administration of VORAXAZE can only be reliably measured by a chromatographic method. DAMPA (4-deoxy-4-amino-N  10  -methylpteroic acid) is an inactive metabolite of methotrexate resulting from treatment with VORAXAZE. DAMPA interferes with the measurement of methotrexate concentration using immunoassays resulting in an erroneous measurement which overestimates the methotrexate concentration. Due to the long half-life of DAMPA (t1/2of approximately 9 hours), measurement of methotrexate using immunoassays is unreliable for samples collected within 48 hours following VORAXAZE administration [ see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.3     Continuation and Timing of Leucovorin Rescue\n\n\n\n  Continue to administer leucovorin after VORAXAZE. Do not administer  leucovorin within 2 hours before or after a dose of VORAXAZE because leucovorin is a substrate for VORAXAZE [ see Drug Interactions (  7.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n For the first 48 hours after VORAXAZE, administer the same leucovorin dose as given prior to VORAXAZE [ see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )  ]. Beyond 48 hours after VORAXAZE, administer leucovorin based on the measured methotrexate concentration. Do not discontinue therapy with leucovorin based on the determination of a single methotrexate concentration below the leucovorin treatment threshold. Therapy with leucovorin should be continued until the methotrexate concentration has been maintained below the leucovorin treatment threshold for a minimum of 3 days.\n\n\n\n Continue hydration and alkalinization of the urine as indicated.\n",

(  5.3  )  \n *   Suicidal thoughts or behaviors: HORIZANT is a prodrug of gabapentin, an antiepileptic drug (AED). AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Monitor for suicidal thoughts or behaviors. (  5.4  )  \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Effects on Driving\n\n\n\n   HORIZANT may cause significant driving impairment [see Clinical Studies (  14.3  )]  . The duration of driving impairment after starting therapy with HORIZANT is unknown.  Patients taking HORIZANT should not drive until they have gained sufficient experience to assess whether HORIZANT impairs their ability to drive. However, prescribers and patients should be aware that patients' ability to assess their own driving competence, as well as their ability to assess the degree of somnolence caused by HORIZANT, can be imperfect. Whether the impairment is related to somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  or other effects of HORIZANT is unknown.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Somnolence/Sedation and Dizziness\n\n\n\n  HORIZANT causes somnolence/sedation and dizziness (see  Tables 4  and  5  ). Patients should be advised not to drive a car or operate other complex machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on HORIZANT to assess whether HORIZANT impairs their ability to perform these tasks.\n\n\n\n During the controlled trials in patients with RLS, somnolence/sedation was reported in 20% of patients treated with 600 mg of HORIZANT per day compared with 6% of patients receiving placebo. In those patients treated with HORIZANT who reported somnolence, the somnolence persisted during treatment in about 30%. In the remaining patients, symptoms resolved within 3 to 4 weeks. Dizziness was reported in 13% of patients receiving 600 mg of HORIZANT per day compared with 4% of patients receiving placebo. In those patients treated with HORIZANT who reported dizziness, symptoms persisted during treatment in about 20%. Somnolence/sedation led to withdrawal in 2% of patients receiving 600 mg of HORIZANT per day. Dizziness led to withdrawal in 1% of patients receiving 600 mg of HORIZANT per day. The incidence of these adverse reactions was greater in the patients receiving 1,200 mg per day.\n\n\n\n During the 12-week, controlled study in patients with PHN, somnolence was reported in 10% of patients treated with 1,200 mg of HORIZANT per day compared with 8% of patients receiving placebo. Fatigue/asthenia was reported in 6% of patients treated with 1,200 mg of HORIZANT per day compared with 1% of patients receiving placebo. In those patients treated with 1,200 mg of HORIZANT per day who reported somnolence (10%), the somnolence persisted during treatment in about 27%. In the remaining patients, symptoms resolved within 4 to 5 weeks. Dizziness was reported in 17% of patients receiving 1,200 mg of HORIZANT per day compared with 15% of patients receiving placebo. In those patients treated with 1,200 mg of HORIZANT per day who reported dizziness, symptoms persisted during treatment in about 6%. Somnolence led to withdrawal in <1% of patients receiving 1,200 mg of HORIZANT per day compared with 2% of patients receiving placebo. Dizziness led to withdrawal in 2% of patients receiving 1,200 mg of HORIZANT per day compared with 3% of patients receiving placebo.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Lack of Interchangeability With Gabapentin\n\n\n\n  HORIZANT is not interchangeable with other gabapentin products because of differing pharmacokinetic profiles. The same dose of HORIZANT results in different plasma concentrations of gabapentin relative to other gabapentin products. [See Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  ).]  \n\n\n\n The safety and effectiveness of HORIZANT in patients with epilepsy have not been studied.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation\n\n\n\n  HORIZANT (gabapentin enacarbil) is a prodrug of gabapentin, an antiepileptic drug (AED). AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Because HORIZANT is a prodrug of gabapentin, HORIZANT also increases this risk. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.\n\n\n\n Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to 1 of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk [adjusted relative risk 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2, 2.7] of suicidal thinking or behavior compared with patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared with 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately 1 case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\n\n\n\n The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.\n\n\n\n The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.\n\n\n\n Table 3.

Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.\n\n\n\n Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that HORIZANT increases the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Drug Reaction With Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity\n\n\n\n  Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. HORIZANT is a prodrug of gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved.\n\n\n\n It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. HORIZANT should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Discontinuation of HORIZANT\n\n\n\n  When discontinuing HORIZANT, patients with RLS receiving 600 mg or less once daily can discontinue the drug without tapering. If the recommended dose is exceeded, the dose should be reduced to 600 mg daily for 1 week prior to discontinuation to minimize the potential of withdrawal seizure.\n\n\n\n In patients with PHN receiving HORIZANT twice daily, the dose should be reduced to once daily for 1 week prior to discontinuation to minimize the potential of withdrawal seizure, see  Table 2   [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.7 Tumorigenic Potential\n\n\n\n  In an oral carcinogenicity study, gabapentin enacarbil increased the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell adenoma and carcinoma in male and female rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.1  )]  . The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.\n\n\n\n In clinical studies of gabapentin as adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2,085 patient-years of exposure in patients >12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence reported in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n  Evaluation of erectile dysfunction (ED) should include an appropriate medical assessment to identify potential underlying causes, as well as treatment options.\n\n\n\n Before prescribing STENDRA, it is important to note the following:\n\n\n\n    EXCERPT:    *  Patients should not use STENDRA if sexual activity is inadvisable due to cardiovascular status or any other reason (5.1) \n *  Use of STENDRA with alpha-blockers, other antihypertensives, or substantial amounts of alcohol (greater than 3 units) may lead to hypotension (2.3,5.6,5.7) \n *  Patients should seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts greater than 4 hours (5.3) \n *  Patients should stop STENDRA and seek medical care if a sudden loss of vision occurs in one or both eyes, which could be a sign of Non Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION). STENDRA should be used with caution, and only when the anticipated benefits outweigh the risks, in patients with a history of NAION. Patients with a \"crowded\" optic disc may also be at an increased risk of NAION (5.4,6.2) \n *  Patients should stop taking STENDRA and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing (5.5) \n    \n   5.1 Cardiovascular Risks\n\n  There is a potential for cardiac risk during sexual activity in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for ED, including STENDRA, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status.\n\n\n\n Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g., aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including STENDRA.\n\n\n\n The following groups of patients were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for STENDRA, and therefore until further information is available, STENDRA is not recommended for the following groups:\n\n\n\n *  Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, life-threatening arrhythmia, or coronary revascularization within the last 6 months; \n *  Patients with resting hypotension (blood pressure less than 90/50 mmHg) or hypertension (blood pressure greater than 170/100 mmHg); \n *  Patients with unstable angina, angina with sexual intercourse, or New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater congestive heart failure. \n    As with other PDE5 inhibitors STENDRA has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications. STENDRA 200 mg resulted in transient decreases in sitting blood pressure in healthy volunteers of 8.0 mmHg systolic and 3.3 mmHg diastolic  [seeClinical Pharmacology (12.2)]  , with the maximum decrease observed at 1 hour after dosing. While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing STENDRA, physicians should carefully consider whether patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity.\n \n\n   5.2 Concomitant Use of CYP3A4 Inhibitors\n\n  STENDRA metabolism is principally mediated by the CYP450 isoform 3A4 (CYP3A4). Inhibitors of CYP3A4 may reduce STENDRA clearance and increase plasma concentrations of avanafil.\n\n\n\n For patients taking concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (including ketoconazole, ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin), do not use STENDRA  [seeDrug Interactions (7.2)].  \n\n\n\n For patients taking concomitant moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (including erythromycin, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil), the maximum recommended dose of STENDRA is 50 mg, not to exceed once every 24 hours  [seeDrug Interactions (7.2)].  \n\n\n\n   5.3 Prolonged Erection\n\n  Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported with other PDE5 inhibitors. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result.\n\n\n\n STENDRA should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia).\n\n\n\n   5.4 Effects on Eye\n\n    Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including STENDRA, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a rare condition and a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors.  \n\n\n\n Based on published literature, the annual incidence of NAION is 2.5-11.8 cases per 100,000 in males aged >= 50. An observational study evaluated whether recent use of PDE5 inhibitors, as a class, was associated with acute onset of NAION. The results suggest an approximate 2-fold increase in the risk of NAION within 5 half-lives of PDE5 inhibitor use. From this information, it is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [  seeAdverse Reactions (6.2)  ].\n\n\n\n Physicians should consider whether their patients with underlying NAION risk factors could be adversely affected by use of PDE5 inhibitors. Individuals who have already experienced NAION are at increased risk of NAION recurrence. Therefore, PDE5 inhibitors, including STENDRA, should be used with caution in these patients and only when the anticipated benefits outweigh the risks. Individuals with \"crowded\" optic disc are also considered at greater risk for NAION compared to the general population, however, evidence is insufficient to support screening of prospective users of PDE5 inhibitors, including STENDRA, for this uncommon condition.\n\n\n\n   5.5 Sudden Hearing Loss\n\n  Use of PDE5 inhibitors has been associated with sudden decrease or loss of hearing, which may be accompanied by tinnitus or dizziness. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors  [seeAdverse Reactions (6)]  . Patients experiencing these symptoms should be advised to stop taking STENDRA and seek prompt medical attention.\n\n\n\n   5.6 Alpha-Blockers and Other Antihypertensives\n\n  Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for STENDRA to augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of alpha-blockers and other antihypertensive medications  [seeDrug Interactions (7.1)andClinical Pharmacology (12.2)].  \n\n\n\n Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, including STENDRA, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting).\n\n\n\n Consideration should be given to the following:\n\n\n\n *  Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating treatment with a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. \n *  In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose (STENDRA 50 mg). \n *  In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. \n    Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs [see  Dosage and Administration (2)  and  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].\n \n\n   5.7 Alcohol\n\n  Patients should be made aware that both alcohol and PDE5 inhibitors including STENDRA act as vasodilators. When vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Therefore, physicians should inform patients that substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., greater than 3 units) in combination with STENDRA may increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache  [seeDrug Interactions (7.1)andClinical Pharmacology (12.2)]  .\n\n\n\n   5.8 Combination with Other PDE5 Inhibitors or Erectile Dysfunction Therapies\n\n  The safety and efficacy of combinations of STENDRA with other treatments for ED has not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended.\n\n\n\n   5.9 Effects on Bleeding\n\n  The safety of STENDRA is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration.  In vitro  studies with human platelets indicate that STENDRA potentiates the anti-aggregatory effect of sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide [NO] donor).\n\n\n\n   5.10 Counseling Patients about Sexually Transmitted Diseases\n\n  The use of STENDRA offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), should be considered.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n     EXCERPT:    *   Peripheral neuropathy : Monitor patients for neuropathy and institute dose modifications accordingly  (5.1)  . \n *   Anaphylaxis and infusion reactions : If an infusion reaction occurs, interrupt the infusion.  If anaphylaxis occurs, immediately discontinue the infusion  (5.2)  . \n *   Hematologic toxicities : Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of ADCETRIS.  Closely monitor patients for fever.  If Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia develops, consider dose delays, reductions, discontinuation, or G-CSF prophylaxis with subsequent doses  (5.3)  . \n *   Serious infections and opportunistic infections : Closely monitor patients for the emergence of bacterial, fungal or viral infections  (5.4)  . \n *   Tumor lysis syndrome : Closely monitor patients with rapidly proliferating tumor or high tumor burden  (5.5)  . \n *   Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin  (5.8)  . \n *   Pulmonary Toxicity : Monitor patients for new or worsening symptoms  (5.10)  . \n *   Serious dermatologic reactions : Discontinue if Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis occurs  (5.10)  . \n *   Embryo-fetal toxicity : Fetal harm can occur.  Advise pregnant women of the potential hazard to the fetus  (5.12)  . \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Peripheral Neuropathy\n\n\n\n  ADCETRIS treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory. Cases of peripheral motor neuropathy have also been reported. ADCETRIS-induced peripheral neuropathy is cumulative. In the relapsed classical HL and sALCL clinical trials, 54% of patients experienced any grade of neuropathy. Of these patients, 49% had complete resolution, 31% had partial improvement, and 20% had no improvement. Of the patients who reported neuropathy, 51% had residual neuropathy at the time of their last evaluation. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain, or weakness. Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy may require a delay, change in dose, or discontinuation of ADCETRIS [see  Dosage and Administration (       2.2       )  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions\n\n\n\n  Infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred with ADCETRIS. Monitor patients during infusion. If anaphylaxis occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue administration of ADCETRIS and administer appropriate medical therapy. If an infusion-related reaction occurs, the infusion should be interrupted and appropriate medical management instituted. Patients who have experienced a prior infusion-related reaction should be premedicated for subsequent infusions. Premedication may include acetaminophen, an antihistamine, and a corticosteroid.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Hematologic Toxicities\n\n\n\n  Prolonged (>=1 week) severe neutropenia and Grade 3 or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or anemia can occur with ADCETRIS. Febrile neutropenia has been reported with treatment with ADCETRIS. Complete blood counts should be monitored prior to each dose of ADCETRIS and more frequent monitoring should be considered for patients with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Monitor patients for fever. If Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia develops, consider dose delays, reductions, discontinuation, or G-CSF prophylaxis with subsequent ADCETRIS doses [see  Dosage and Administration (       2.2       )  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4 Serious Infections and Opportunistic Infections\n\n\n\n  Serious infections and opportunistic infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis or septic shock (including fatal outcomes) have been reported in patients treated with ADCETRIS. Patients should be closely monitored during treatment for the emergence of possible bacterial, fungal, or viral infections.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Patients with rapidly proliferating tumor and high tumor burden may be at increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Monitor closely and take appropriate measures.\n\n\n\n     5.6 Increased Toxicity in the Presence of Severe Renal Impairment  \n\n\n\n   The frequency of >=Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. Due to higher MMAE exposure, >=Grade 3 adverse reactions may be more frequent in patients with severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. Avoid the use of ADCETRIS in patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CLcr) <30 mL/min] [see  Use in Specific Populations (       8.6       )  ].    \n\n\n\n     5.7 Increased Toxicity in the Presence of Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment  \n\n\n\n   The frequency of >=Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Avoid the use of ADCETRIS in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment [see  Use in Specific Populations (       8.7       )  ]  .  \n\n\n\n     5.8 Hepatotoxicity  \n\n\n\n   Serious cases of hepatotoxicity, including fatal outcomes, have occurred in patients receiving ADCETRIS. Cases were consistent with hepatocellular injury, including elevations of transaminases and/or bilirubin. Cases have occurred after the first dose of ADCETRIS or after ADCETRIS rechallenge. Preexisting liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant medications may also increase the risk. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin. Patients experiencing new, worsening, or recurrent hepatotoxicity may require a delay, change in dose, or discontinuation of ADCETRIS.   \n\n\n\n    5.9 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy\n\n\n\n   JC virus infection resulting in PML and death has been reported in ADCETRIS-treated patients. First onset of symptoms occurred at various times from initiation of ADCETRIS therapy, with some cases occurring within 3 months of initial exposure. In addition to ADCETRIS therapy, other possible contributory factors include prior therapies and underlying disease that may cause immunosuppression. Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset signs and symptoms of central nervous system abnormalities. Hold ADCETRIS dosing for any suspected case of PML and discontinue ADCETRIS dosing if a diagnosis of PML is confirmed.  \n\n\n\n     5.10 Pulmonary Toxicity  \n\n\n\n   Events of noninfectious pulmonary toxicity including pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), some with fatal outcomes, have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pulmonary toxicity, including cough and dyspnea. In the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms, hold ADCETRIS dosing during evaluation and until symptomatic improvement.  \n\n\n\n     5.11 Serious Dermatologic Reactions  \n\n\n\n   Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), including fatal outcomes, have been reported with ADCETRIS. If SJS or TEN occurs, discontinue ADCETRIS and administer appropriate medical therapy.  \n\n\n\n    5.12 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ADCETRIS in pregnant women. However, based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ADCETRIS can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Brentuximab vedotin caused embryo-fetal toxicities, including significantly decreased embryo viability and fetal malformations, in animals at maternal exposures that were similar to human exposures at the recommended doses for patients with classical HL and sALCL. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving the drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see  Use in Specific Populations (       8.1       )  ]  .\n",

Monitor CrCl at least daily in patients with changing renal function and adjust the dose of ZERBAXA accordingly. (  5.1  ) \n *  Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported with beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Exercise caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. (  5.2  ) \n *   Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including ZERBAXA. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (  5.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Decreased Efficacy in Patients with Baseline Creatinine Clearance of 30 to <=50 mL/min\n\n\n\n  In a subgroup analysis of a Phase 3 cIAI trial, clinical cure rates were lower in patients with baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 to <=50 mL/min compared to those with CrCl >=50 mL/min (Table 4). The reduction in clinical cure rates was more marked in the ZERBAXA plus metronidazole arm compared to the meropenem arm. A similar trend was also seen in the cUTI trial. Monitor CrCl at least daily in patients with changing renal function and adjust the dosage of ZERBAXA accordingly [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Table 4: Clinical Cure Rates in a Phase 3 Trial of cIAI by Baseline Renal Function (MITT Population) \n Baseline Renal Function             ZERBAXA plus metronidazolen/N (%)          Meropenemn/N (%)            \n  \n Normal/mild impairment(CrCl >=50 mL/min)           312/366 (85.2)                     355/404 (87.9)             \n Moderate impairment(CrCl 30 to <=50 mL/min)            11/23 (47.8)                        9/13 (69.2)              \n            5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n \n\n  Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterial drugs.\n\n\n\n Before initiating therapy with ZERBAXA, make careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to other cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactams. If this product is to be given to a patient with a cephalosporin, penicillin, or other beta-lactam allergy, exercise caution because cross sensitivity has been established. If an anaphylactic reaction to ZERBAXA occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Clostridium difficile  -associated Diarrhea\n\n\n\n   Clostridium difficile  -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including ZERBAXA, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C  . difficile  .\n\n\n\n  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.\n\n\n\n If CDAD is confirmed, discontinue antibacterials not directed against C. difficile  , if possible. Manage fluid and electrolyte levels as appropriate, supplement protein intake, monitor antibacterial treatment of C. difficile  , and institute surgical evaluation as clinically indicated.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria\n\n\n\n  Prescribing ZERBAXA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and risks the development of drug-resistant bacteria.\n",

(  5.5  ) \n *  Anaphylaxis: Monitor patients for anaphylaxis and discontinue Zydelig. (  5.6  ) \n *  Neutropenia: monitor blood counts. (  5.7  ) \n *  Embryo-fetal toxicity: may cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy while taking Zydelig. (  5.8  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hepatotoxicity\n\n\n\n  Fatal and/or serious hepatotoxicity occurred in 14% of patients treated with Zydelig. Elevations in ALT or AST greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal have occurred [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  These findings were generally observed within the first 12 weeks of treatment and were reversible with dose interruption. After resumption of treatment at a lower dose, 26% of patients had recurrence of ALT and AST elevations. Discontinue Zydelig for recurrent hepatotoxicity.\n\n\n\n Avoid concurrent use of Zydelig with other drugs that may cause liver toxicity.\n\n\n\n Monitor ALT and AST in all patients every 2 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, every 4 weeks for the next 3 months, then every 1 to 3 months thereafter. Monitor weekly for liver toxicity if the ALT or AST rises above 3 times the upper limit of normal until resolved. Withhold Zydelig if the ALT or AST is greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal, and continue to monitor AST, ALT and total bilirubin weekly until the abnormality is resolved [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Severe Diarrhea or Colitis\n\n\n\n  Severe diarrhea or colitis (Grade 3 or higher) occurred in 14% of Zydelig-treated patients across clinical trials [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  Diarrhea can occur at any time. Avoid concurrent use of Zydelig and other drugs that cause diarrhea. Diarrhea due to Zydelig responds poorly to antimotility agents. Median time to resolution ranged between 1 week and 1 month across trials, following interruption of Zydelig therapy and in some instances, use of corticosteroids [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Pneumonitis\n\n\n\n  Fatal and serious pneumonitis occurred in patients treated with Zydelig. Patients taking Zydelig who present with pulmonary symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, interstitial infiltrates on a radiologic exam, or a decline by more than 5% in oxygen saturation should be evaluated for pneumonitis. If pneumonitis is suspected, interrupt Zydelig until the etiology of the pulmonary symptoms has been determined. Patients with pneumonitis thought to be caused by Zydelig have been treated with discontinuation of Zydelig and administration of corticosteroids.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Intestinal Perforation\n\n\n\n  Fatal and serious intestinal perforation occurred in Zydelig-treated patients. At the time of perforation, some patients had moderate to severe diarrhea. Advise patients to promptly report any new or worsening abdominal pain, chills, fever, nausea, or vomiting. Discontinue Zydelig permanently in patients who experience intestinal perforation.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Severe Cutaneous Reactions\n\n\n\n  One case of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) occurred in a study of Zydelig in combination with rituximab and bendamustine. Other severe or life-threatening (Grade >=3) cutaneous reactions, including dermatitis exfoliative, rash, rash erythematous, rash generalized, rash macular, rash maculo-papular, rash papular, rash pruritic, exfoliative rash, and skin disorder, have been reported in Zydelig-treated patients. Monitor patients for the development of severe cutaneous reactions and discontinue Zydelig.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Anaphylaxis\n\n\n\n  Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients on Zydelig. In patients who develop serious allergic reactions, discontinue Zydelig permanently and institute appropriate supportive measures.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Neutropenia\n\n\n\n  Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 31% of Zydelig-treated patients across clinical trials [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  Monitor blood counts at least every two weeks for the first 3 months of therapy, and at least weekly in patients while neutrophil counts are less than 1.0 Gi/L [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.8 Embryo-fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Based on findings in animals, Zydelig may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Idelalisib is teratogenic in rats, at systemic exposures 12 times those reported in patients at the recommended dose of 150 mg twice daily. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant while taking Zydelig. If contraceptive methods are being considered, use effective contraception during treatment, and for at least 1 month after the last dose of Zydelig [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ].  \n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Serious infections - Do not start SIMPONI ARIA during an active infection. If an infection develops, monitor carefully, and stop SIMPONI ARIA if infection becomes serious (  5.1  ). \n *  Invasive fungal infections - For patients who develop a systemic illness on SIMPONI ARIA, consider empiric antifungal therapy for those who reside in or travel to regions where mycoses are endemic (  5.1  ). \n *  Hepatitis B reactivation - Monitor HBV carriers during and several months after therapy. If reactivation occurs, stop SIMPONI ARIA and begin anti-viral therapy (  5.1  ). \n *  Malignancies - More cases of lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving TNF-blockers compared with patients in the control groups. Cases of other malignancies have been observed among patients receiving TNF-blockers (  5.2  ). \n *  Heart failure - Worsening, or new onset, may occur. Stop SIMPONI ARIA if new or worsening symptoms occur (  5.3  ). \n *  Demyelinating disease, exacerbation or new onset, may occur (  5.4  ). \n *  Hypersensitivity reactions: Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis may occur (  5.10  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Serious Infections\n\n\n\n  Patients treated with SIMPONI ARIA are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death.\n\n\n\n Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or parasitic organisms including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis, and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF-blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease. The concomitant use of a TNF-blocker and abatacept or anakinra was associated with a higher risk of serious infections; therefore, the concomitant use of SIMPONI ARIA and these biologic products is not recommended [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.5  ,  5.6  ) and  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Treatment with SIMPONI ARIA should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including clinically important localized infections. Patients greater than 65 years of age, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids or methotrexate may be at greater risk of infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating SIMPONI ARIA in patients:\n\n\n\n *  with chronic or recurrent infection; \n *  who have been exposed to tuberculosis; \n *  with a history of an opportunistic infection; \n *  who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis; or \n *  with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. \n       Monitoring  \n \n\n Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with SIMPONI ARIA. Discontinue SIMPONI ARIA if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. For patients who develop a new infection during treatment with SIMPONI ARIA, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy and closely monitor them.\n\n\n\n    Tuberculosis  \n\n\n\n Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis or new tuberculosis infections have been observed in patients receiving TNF-blockers, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating SIMPONI ARIA and periodically during therapy.\n\n\n\n Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF-blockers has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating SIMPONI ARIA, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; An induration of 5 mm or greater is a positive tuberculin skin test, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG).\n\n\n\n Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of SIMPONI ARIA in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.\n\n\n\n  Cases of active tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with the subcutaneous formulation of golimumab during and after treatment for latent tuberculosis. Monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis including patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy, patients who are on treatment for latent tuberculosis, or patients who were previously treated for tuberculosis infection.  \n\n\n\n Consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during SIMPONI ARIA treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis.\n\n\n\n    Invasive Fungal Infections  \n\n\n\n If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy and take into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy while a diagnostic workup is being performed. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections.\n\n\n\n    Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation  \n\n\n\n The use of TNF-blockers, of which SIMPONI ARIA is a member, has been associated with reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic hepatitis B carriers (i.e., surface antigen positive). In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF-blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients who received concomitant immunosuppressants.\n\n\n\n All patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating TNF-blocker therapy. For patients who test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended before initiating TNF-blocker therapy. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to prescribing TNF-blockers, including SIMPONI ARIA, to patients who are carriers of HBV. Adequate data are not available on whether anti-viral therapy can reduce the risk of HBV reactivation in HBV carriers who are treated with TNF-blockers. Patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF-blockers should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy.\n\n\n\n In patients who develop HBV reactivation, TNF-blockers should be stopped and antiviral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. The safety of resuming TNF-blockers after HBV reactivation has been controlled is not known. Therefore, prescribers should exercise caution when considering resumption of TNF-blockers in this situation and monitor patients closely.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Malignancies\n\n\n\n   Malignancies in Pediatric Patients  \n\n\n\n Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blocking agents (initiation of therapy <= 18 years of age), of which SIMPONI ARIA is a member. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of malignancies, including rare malignancies that are usually associated with immunosuppression, and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months (range 1 to 84 months) after the first dose of TNF-blocker therapy. Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post-marketing and are derived from a variety of sources, including registries and spontaneous post-marketing reports. Use of SIMPONI ARIA in patients under 18 years of age has not been established.\n\n\n\n    Malignancies in Adult Patients  \n\n\n\n The risks and benefits of TNF-blocker treatment including SIMPONI ARIA should be considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing a TNF-blocker in patients who develop a malignancy.\n\n\n\n In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-blockers including the subcutaneous formulation of golimumab more cases of lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving anti-TNF treatment compared with patients in the control groups. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly patients with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF-blocking therapy. Cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported with post-marketing TNF-blocker use in rheumatoid arthritis and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with rheumatoid arthritis may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia.\n\n\n\n  Rare post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients treated with TNF-blocking agents. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal. Nearly all of the reported TNF-blocker associated cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) concomitantly with a TNF-blocker at or prior to diagnosis. A risk for the development for hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with TNF-blockers cannot be excluded.  \n\n\n\n Melanoma has been reported in patients treated with TNF-blocking agents, including the subcutaneous formulation of golimumab. Merkel cell carcinoma has been reported in patients treated with TNF-blocking agents. Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer.\n\n\n\n In controlled trials of other TNF-blockers in patients at higher risk for malignancies (e.g., patients with COPD, patients with Wegener's granulomatosis treated with concomitant cyclophosphamide) a greater portion of malignancies occurred in the TNF-blocker group compared to the controlled group. In an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of the subcutaneous formulation of golimumab in patients with severe persistent asthma, more patients treated with golimumab reported malignancies compared with control patients. The significance of this finding is unknown.\n\n\n\n During the controlled portion of the Phase 3 trial in RA for SIMPONI ARIA, the incidence of malignancies other than lymphoma and NMSC per 100-patient-years of follow-up was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.01, 3.11) in the SIMPONI ARIA group compared with an incidence of 0 (95% CI: 0.00, 3.79) in the placebo group.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Congestive Heart Failure\n\n\n\n  Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF-blockers, including SIMPONI ARIA. In several exploratory trials of other TNF-blockers in the treatment of CHF, there were greater proportions of TNF-blocker treated patients who had CHF exacerbations requiring hospitalization or increased mortality. SIMPONI ARIA has not been studied in patients with a history of CHF and SIMPONI ARIA should be used with caution in patients with CHF. If a decision is made to administer SIMPONI ARIA to RA patients with CHF, these patients should be closely monitored during therapy, and SIMPONI ARIA should be discontinued if new or worsening symptoms of CHF appear.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Demyelinating Disorders\n\n\n\n  Use of TNF-blockers, of which SIMPONI ARIA is a member, has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and peripheral demyelinating disorders, including Guillain-Barre syndrome. Cases of central demyelination, MS, optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathy have rarely been reported in patients treated with the subcutaneous formulation of golimumab. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of TNF-blockers, including SIMPONI ARIA, in patients with central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders. Discontinuation of SIMPONI ARIA should be considered if these disorders develop.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Use with Abatacept\n\n\n\n  In controlled trials, the concurrent administration of another TNF-blocker and abatacept was associated with a greater proportion of serious infections than the use of a TNF-blocker alone; and the combination therapy, compared to the use of a TNF-blocker alone, has not demonstrated improved clinical benefit in the treatment of RA. Therefore, the combination of TNF-blockers including SIMPONI ARIA and abatacept is not recommended [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.6 Use with Anakinra\n\n\n\n  Concurrent administration of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF-blocker, was associated with a greater portion of serious infections and neutropenia and no additional benefits compared with the TNF-blocker alone. Therefore, the combination of anakinra with TNF-blockers, including SIMPONI ARIA, is not recommended [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.7 Switching Between Biological Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs)\n\n\n\n  Care should be taken when switching from one biologic product to another biologic product since overlapping biological activity may further increase the risk of infection.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Hematologic Cytopenias\n\n\n\n  There have been post-marketing reports of pancytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, aplastic anemia, and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving TNF-blockers. In clinical studies, cases of pancytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia have also occurred in SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients. Caution should be exercised when using TNF-blockers, including SIMPONI ARIA, in patients who have or have had significant cytopenias.\n\n\n\n    5.9 Vaccinations/Therapeutic Infectious Agents\n\n\n\n    Live Vaccines    \n\n\n\n  Patients treated with SIMPONI ARIA may receive vaccinations, except for live vaccines. In patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, limited data are available on the response to live vaccination, or on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines. Use of live vaccines could result in clinical infections, including disseminated infections.  \n\n\n\n     Therapeutic Infectious Agents    \n\n\n\n  Other uses of therapeutic infectious agents such as live attenuated bacteria (e.g., BCG bladder instillation for the treatment of cancer) could result in clinical infections, including disseminated infections. It is recommended that therapeutic infectious agents not be given concurrently with SIMPONI ARIA.  \n\n\n\n    5.10 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  In post-marketing experience, serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reaction) have been reported following administration of the subcutaneous formulation of golimumab. Some of these reactions occurred after the first administration of golimumab. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of SIMPONI ARIA should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted.\n",

(  5.3  ) \n *  Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines: Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery while BLINCYTO is being administered. (  5.6  ) \n *  Preparation and Administration Errors: Strictly follow instructions for preparation (including admixing) and administration. (  5.9  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1     Cytokine Release Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in patients receiving BLINCYTO. \n\n\n\n Infusion reactions have occurred with the BLINCYTO infusion and may be clinically indistinguishable from manifestations of CRS .   \n\n\n\n Serious adverse events that may be associated with CRS included pyrexia, headache, nausea, asthenia, hypotension, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and increased total bilirubin; these events infrequently led to BLINCYTO discontinuation. Life-threatening or fatal CRS was infrequently reported in patients receiving BLINCYTO. In some cases, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), capillary leak syndrome (CLS), and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) have been reported in the setting of CRS. \n\n\n\n Patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of these events. Management of these events may require either temporary interruption or discontinuation of BLINCYTO [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2     Neurological Toxicities\n\n\n\n  In patients receiving BLINCYTO in clinical trials, neurological toxicities have occurred in approximately 50% of patients. The median time to onset of any neurological toxicity was 7 days. Grade 3 or higher (severe, life-threatening, or fatal) neurological toxicities following initiation of BLINCYTO administration occurred in approximately 15% of patients and included encephalopathy, convulsions, speech disorders, disturbances in consciousness, confusion and disorientation, and coordination and balance disorders. The majority of events resolved following interruption of BLINCYTO, but some resulted in treatment discontinuation. \n\n\n\n Monitor patients receiving BLINCYTO for signs and symptoms of neurological toxicities, and interrupt or discontinue BLINCYTO as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )].     \n\n\n\n    5.3     Infections\n\n\n\n  In patients receiving BLINCYTO in clinical trials, serious infections such as sepsis, pneumonia, bacteremia, opportunistic infections, and catheter-site infections were observed in approximately 25% of patients, some of which were life-threatening or fatal. As appropriate, administer prophylactic antibiotics and employ surveillance testing during treatment with BLINCYTO.  Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat appropriately.\n\n\n\n    5.4     Tumor Lysis Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which may be life-threatening or fatal, has been observed in patients receiving BLINCYTO. Appropriate prophylactic measures, including pretreatment nontoxic cytoreduction and on-treatment hydration, should be used for the prevention of TLS during BLINCYTO treatment. Monitor for signs or symptoms of TLS. Management of these events may require either temporary interruption or discontinuation of BLINCYTO [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5     Neutropenia and Febrile Neutropenia\n\n\n\n  Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, including life-threatening cases, have been observed in patients receiving BLINCYTO. Monitor laboratory parameters (including, but not limited to, white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count) during BLINCYTO infusion. Interrupt BLINCYTO if prolonged neutropenia occurs. \n\n\n\n    5.6     Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines\n\n\n\n  Due to the potential for neurologic events, including seizures, patients receiving BLINCYTO are at risk for loss of consciousness [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )]  . Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery while BLINCYTO is being administered. \n\n\n\n    5.7     Elevated Liver Enzymes\n\n\n\n  Treatment with BLINCYTO was associated with transient elevations in liver enzymes. Although the majority of these events were observed in the setting of CRS, some were observed outside of this setting. For these events, the median time to onset was 15 days.  In patients receiving BLINCYTO in clinical trials, Grade 3 or greater elevations in liver enzymes occurred in approximately 6% of patients outside the setting of CRS and resulted in treatment discontinuation in less than 1% of patients.\n\n\n\n Monitor alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and total blood bilirubin prior to the start of and during BLINCYTO treatment. Interrupt BLINCYTO if the transaminases rise to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal or if bilirubin rises to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal .  \n\n\n\n    5.8     Leukoencephalopathy\n\n\n\n  Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes showing leukoencephalopathy have been observed in patients receiving BLINCYTO, especially in patients with prior treatment with cranial irradiation and antileukemic chemotherapy (including systemic high-dose methotrexate or intrathecal cytarabine). The clinical significance of these imaging changes is unknown.    \n\n\n\n    5.9     Preparation and Administration Errors\n\n\n\n  Preparation and administration errors have occurred with BLINCYTO treatment. Follow instructions for preparation (including admixing) and administration strictly to minimize medication errors (including underdose and overdose) [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ) and (  2.4  )]  .\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *     Vascular risks : Stop Natazia if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop Natazia at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start Natazia no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. (  5.1  ) \n *     Liver disease : Discontinue Natazia if jaundice occurs. (  5.3  ) \n *     High blood pressure : Do not prescribe Natazia for women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease. (  5.4  ) \n *     Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects : Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Natazia. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. (  5.6  ) \n *     Headache : Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Natazia if indicated. (  5.7  ) \n *     Uterine bleeding : Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. (  5.8  ) \n *     CYP3A4 induction : Women taking strong CYP3A4 inducers (for example, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John's wort) should not choose Natazia as their oral contraceptive due to the possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy. (  5.13  ,  7.1  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems\n\n\n\n  Stop Natazia if an arterial or venous thrombotic event (VTE) occurs.\n\n\n\n The use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolism. However, pregnancy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC.\n\n\n\n Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events.\n\n\n\n The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued.\n\n\n\n If feasible, stop Natazia at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism.\n\n\n\n Start Natazia no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week.\n\n\n\n COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke. COCs also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors.\n\n\n\n Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.\n\n\n\n Stop Natazia if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately. [See Adverse Reactions (    6   ).]  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Carcinoma of the Breasts and Reproductive Organs\n\n\n\n  Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use Natazia because breast cancer is a hormonally-sensitive tumor.\n\n\n\n There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer. Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer, more recent studies have not confirmed such findings.\n\n\n\n Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.\n\n\n\n Endometrial biopsies performed in a subset of subjects in a Phase 3 Natazia clinical trial did not reveal any unexpected or concerning findings for subjects taking COCs. [See Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ).]  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Liver Disease\n\n\n\n  Discontinue Natazia if jaundice develops. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded.\n\n\n\n Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.\n\n\n\n Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.\n\n\n\n Oral contraceptive-related cholestasis may occur in women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis. Women with a history of COC-related cholestasis may have the condition recur with subsequent COC use.\n\n\n\n    5.4 High Blood Pressure\n\n\n\n  For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Natazia if blood pressure rises significantly. Women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease should not use COCs.\n\n\n\n An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Gallbladder Disease\n\n\n\n  Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects\n\n\n\n  Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking Natazia. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance in a dose-related fashion.\n\n\n\n Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs.\n\n\n\n Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Headache\n\n\n\n  If a woman taking Natazia develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Natazia if indicated.\n\n\n\n An increase in frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) may be a reason for immediate discontinuation of the COC.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Bleeding Irregularities\n\n\n\n  Breakthrough bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.\n\n\n\n Women who are not pregnant and use Natazia, may experience amenorrhea. Based on patient diaries, amenorrhea occurs in approximately 16% of cycles in women using Natazia. Pregnancy should be ruled out in the event of amenorrhea occurring in two or more consecutive cycles. Some women may encounter amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.\n\n\n\n Based on patient diaries from three clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of Natazia for contraception, 10-23% of women experienced intracyclic bleeding per cycle.\n\n\n\n    5.9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy\n\n\n\n  Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.\n\n\n\n The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.10 Depression\n\n\n\n  Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and Natazia discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree .  \n\n\n\n    5.11 Interference with Laboratory Tests\n\n\n\n  The use of COCs may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increase with use of COCs [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.12 Monitoring\n\n\n\n  A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare.\n\n\n\n    5.13 Drug Interactions\n\n\n\n  Women who take medications that are strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducers (for example, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin, and St. John's wort) should not choose Natazia as their oral contraceptive while using these inducers and for at least 28 days after discontinuation of these inducers due to the possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy. [See Drug Interactions (  7.1  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  ).]  \n\n\n\n    5.14 Other Conditions\n\n\n\n  In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking COCs.\n",

(  5.1  ) \n *  Acute hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, dyspnea, pruritus, and rash) have been reported. In the event of a severe reaction, discontinue DIFICID. (  5.2  ) \n *  Development of drug-resistant bacteria: Only use DIFICID for infection proven or strongly suspected to be caused by C. difficile . (  5.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Not for Systemic Infections\n\n\n\n  Since there is minimal systemic absorption of fidaxomicin, DIFICID is not effective for treatment of systemic infections.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Acute hypersensitivity reactions, including dyspnea, rash pruritus, and angioedema of the mouth, throat, and face have been reported with fidaxomicin. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, DIFICID  (r)  should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted.\n\n\n\n Some patients with hypersensitivity reactions also reported a history of allergy to other macrolides. Physicians prescribing DIFICID to patients with a known macrolide allergy should be aware of the possibility of hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria\n\n\n\n  Prescribing DIFICID in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected C. difficile  infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.\n",

(5.2) \n *  Monitor for worsening renal function in patients with renal impairment. (5.3) \n    \n   5.1 Fetal Toxicity\n\n  Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Edarbi as soon as possible  [seeUse in Specific Populations (8.1)].  \n\n\n\n   5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients\n\n  In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with Edarbi. Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of Edarbi, or start treatment at 40 mg. If hypotension does occur, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline  .  A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.\n\n\n\n   5.3 Impaired Renal Function\n\n  As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Edarbi. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure, renal artery stenosis, or volume depletion), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers has been associated with oliguria or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Edarbi  [seeDrug Interactions (7),Use in Specific Populations (8.6), andClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  \n\n\n\n In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen have been reported. There has been no long-term use of Edarbi in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar results may be expected.\n",

Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy while taking the drug (  5.7  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hemorrhage\n\n\n\n   Fatal bleeding events have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Grade 3 or higher bleeding events (subdural hematoma, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria and post procedural hemorrhage) have occurred in up to 6% of patients. Bleeding events of any grade, including bruising and petechiae, occurred in approximately half of patients treated with IMBRUVICA.  \n\n\n\n The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood.\n\n\n\n IMBRUVICA may increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies.\n\n\n\n Consider the benefit-risk of withholding IMBRUVICA for at least 3 to 7 days pre and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Infections\n\n\n\n  Fatal and non-fatal infections have occurred with IMBRUVICA therapy. Grade 3 or greater infections occurred in 14% to 26% of patients. [See  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Monitor patients for fever and infections and evaluate promptly.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Cytopenias\n\n\n\n  Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias including neutropenia (range, 19 to 29%), thrombocytopenia (range, 5 to 17%), and anemia (range, 0 to 9%) occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA.\n\n\n\n Monitor complete blood counts monthly.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Atrial Fibrillation\n\n\n\n  Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (range, 6 to 9%) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA, particularly in patients with cardiac risk factors, acute infections, and a previous history of atrial fibrillation. Periodically monitor patients clinically for atrial fibrillation. Patients who develop arrhythmic symptoms (e.g., palpitations, lightheadedness) or new onset dyspnea should have an ECG performed. If atrial fibrillation persists, consider the risks and benefits of IMBRUVICA treatment and dose modification [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Second Primary Malignancies\n\n\n\n  Other malignancies (range, 5 to 14%) including non-skin carcinomas (range, 1 to 3%) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. The most frequent second primary malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer (range, 4 to 11 %).\n\n\n\n    5.6 Tumor Lysis Syndrome\n\n\n\n   Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported with IMBRUVICA therapy. Monitor patients closely and take appropriate precautions in patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome (e.g. high tumor burden).  \n\n\n\n    5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Based on findings in animals, IMBRUVICA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Ibrutinib caused malformations in rats at exposures 14 times those reported in patients with MCL and 20 times those reported in patients with CLL or WM, receiving the ibrutinib dose of 560 mg per day and 420 mg per day, respectively. Reduced fetal weights were observed at lower exposures. Advise women to avoid becoming pregnant while taking IMBRUVICA. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .\n",

Elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 27% of 255 patients in Study 1. One patient (0.4%) required permanent discontinuation due to elevated transaminases, and jaundice. Concurrent elevations in ALT greater than 3 times the ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 times the ULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, occurred in less than 1% of patients in clinical studies.  \n\n\n\n Monitor with liver laboratory tests including ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin once a month and as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase elevations. Based on the severity of the adverse drug reaction, withhold ZYKADIA with resumption at a reduced dose, or permanently discontinue ZYKADIA as described in Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.3     Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis\n\n\n\n  Severe, life-threatening, or fatal ILD/pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with ZYKADIA. In Study 1, pneumonitis was reported in 4% of 255 patients treated with ZYKADIA. CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 ILD/pneumonitis was reported in 3% of patients, and fatal ILD/pneumonitis was reported in 1 patient (0.4%) in Study 1. One percent (1%) of patients discontinued ZYKADIA in Study 1 due to ILD/pneumonitis.\n\n\n\n Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Exclude other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis, and permanently discontinue ZYKADIA in patients diagnosed with treatment-related ILD/pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4     QT Interval Prolongation\n\n\n\n   QTc interval prolongation, which may lead to an increased risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g., Torsade de pointes) or sudden death, occurred in patients treated with ZYKADIA in clinical trials. Three percent (3%) of 255 patients experienced a QTc interval increase over baseline greater than 60 msec in Study 1. Across the development program of ZYKADIA, one of 304 patients (less than 1%) treated with ZYKADIA doses ranging from 50 to 750 mg was found to have a QTc greater than 500 msec and 3% of patients had an increase from baseline QTc greater than 60 msec. A pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that ZYKADIA causes concentration-dependent increases in the QTc interval.  \n\n\n\n When possible, avoid use of ZYKADIA in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Conduct periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are taking medications that are known to prolong the QTc interval. Withhold ZYKADIA in patients who develop a QTc interval greater than 500 msec on at least 2 separate ECGs until the QTc interval is less than 481 msec or recovery to baseline if the QTc interval is greater than or equal to 481 msec, then resume ZYKADIA at a reduced dose as described in Table 1. Permanently discontinue ZYKADIA in patients who develop QTc interval prolongation in combination with Torsade de pointes or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5     Hyperglycemia\n\n\n\n  Hyperglycemia can occur in patients receiving ZYKADIA. In Study 1, CTCAE Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia, based on laboratory values, occurred in 13% of 255 patients. There was a 6-fold increase in the risk of CTCAE Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance and a 2-fold increase in patients taking corticosteroids.\n\n\n\n  Monitor fasting serum glucose prior to the start of ZYKADIA treatment and periodically thereafter as clinically indicated. Initiate or optimize anti-hyperglycemic medications as indicated. Based on the severity of the adverse drug reaction, withhold ZYKADIA until hyperglycemia is adequately controlled, then resume ZYKADIA at a reduced dose as described in Table 1. If adequate hyperglycemic control cannot be achieved with optimal medical management, permanently discontinue ZYKADIA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6)]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.6     Bradycardia\n\n\n\n  Bradycardia can occur in patients receiving ZYKADIA. In Study 1, sinus bradycardia, defined as a heart rate of less than 50 beats per minute, was noted as a new finding in 1% of 255 patients. Bradycardia was reported as an adverse drug reaction in 3% of patients in Study 1.\n\n\n\n Avoid using ZYKADIA in combination with other agents known to cause bradycardia (e.g., beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, clonidine, and digoxin) to the extent possible. Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. In cases of symptomatic bradycardia that is not life-threatening, withhold ZYKADIA until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above, evaluate the use of concomitant medications, and adjust the dose of ZYKADIA. Permanently discontinue ZYKADIA for life-threatening bradycardia if no contributing concomitant medication is identified; however, if associated with a concomitant medication known to cause bradycardia or hypotension, withhold ZYKADIA until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above, and if the concomitant medication can be adjusted or discontinued, resume ZYKADIA at a reduced dose as described in Table 1 upon recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above, with frequent monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.7     Pancreatitis\n\n\n\n   Pancreatitis, including one fatality, has been reported in less than 1% of patients receiving ZYKADIA in clinical trials. CTCAE Grade 3-4 elevations of lipase and/or amylase occurred in 15% of patients receiving ZYKADIA in Study 1. Monitor lipase and amylase prior to the start of ZYKADIA treatment and periodically thereafter as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of the laboratory abnormalities, withhold ZYKADIA with resumption at a reduced dose as described in Table 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6)]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.8     Embryofetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Based on its mechanism of action, ZYKADIA may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, administration of ceritinib to rats and rabbits during organogenesis at maternal plasma exposures below the recommended human dose of 750 mg daily caused increases in skeletal anomalies in rats and rabbits. Apprise women of reproductive potential of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]  . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ZYKADIA and for at least 2 weeks following completion of therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]  .\n",

Ensure safe handling to protect the patient and health care worker (  5.3  ). \n    \n \n\n    5.1             Imaging   Errors  \n\n\n\n  Imaging errors have been reported with  11  C-choline PET and PET/CT imaging. A negative image does not rule out the presence of recurrent prostate cancer and a positive image does not confirm the presence of recurrent cancer.  11  C-choline uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer (such as lung carcinoma and brain tumors). Clinical correlation, including histopathological evaluation of the suspected recurrence site, is essential to proper use of the PET imaging information.\n\n\n\n *  Blood PSA levels < 2 ng/mL have been associated with poor performance of  11  C-choline PET imaging (higher numbers of false positive and false negative results) [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. \n *  Tissue inflammation as well as prostatic hyperplasia have been associated with false positive  11  C-choline PET images. \n *  Concomitant colchicine or androgen-deprivation therapeutic drugs (such as luteinizing hormone-releasing analogs and anti-androgen drugs) may interfere with  11  C-choline PET imaging. One published report of  18  F-methylcholine PET imaging indicated that discontinuation of colchicine for two weeks resolved the colchicine effect. The impact of discontinuation of androgen-deprivation therapy upon  11  C-choline PET imaging has not been established [ see Drug Interactions   (7) ]. \n        5.2             Allergic Reactions  \n \n\n  As with any injectable drug product, allergic reactions and anaphylaxis may occur. Emergency resuscitation equipment and personnel should be immediately available.\n\n\n\n     5.3             Radiation Risks  \n\n\n\n  Choline C 11 Injection contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk for cancer. Safe handling should be ensured to minimize radiation exposure to the patient and health care workers [ see    Dosage and Administration   (   2.   1   )  ].\n",

Perform appropriate monitoring and treat hyperglycemia with insulin, as necessary (5.3) \n *    Thrombosis, hemorrhage: discontinue ERWINAZE until resolved (5.4) \n    \n   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n    Grade 3 and 4 hypersensitivity reactions after the use of ERWINAZE have occurred in 5% of patients in clinical trials [  see Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n Administer this product in a setting with resuscitation equipment and other agents necessary to treat anaphylaxis. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue ERWINAZE and initiate appropriate therapy.\n\n\n\n   5.2 Pancreatitis\n\n    Pancreatitis has been reported in 4% of patients in clinical trials [  see Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n Evaluate patients with symptoms compatible with pancreatitis to establish a diagnosis. Discontinue ERWINAZE for severe or hemorrhagic pancreatitis manifested by abdominal pain > 72 hours and amylase elevation >= 2.0 x ULN. Severe pancreatitis is a contraindication to additional asparaginase administration. In the case of mild pancreatitis, hold ERWINAZE until the signs and symptoms subside and amylase levels return to normal. After resolution, treatment with ERWINAZE may be resumed.\n\n\n\n   5.3 Glucose Intolerance\n\n    Glucose intolerance has been reported in 5% of patients receiving ERWINAZE in clinical trials [  see Adverse Reactions       (6.1)  ]. In some cases glucose intolerance may be irreversible. Monitor glucose levels in patients at baseline and periodically during treatment. Administer insulin therapy as necessary in patients with hyperglycemia.\n\n\n\n   5.4 Thrombosis and Hemorrhage\n\n  Serious thrombotic events, including sagittal sinus thrombosis and pulmonary embolism have been reported with both  E. coli  and  Erwinia  -derived L-asparaginase therapy. The following coagulation proteins were decreased in the majority of patients after a 2-week course of ERWINAZE by intramuscular administration: fibrinogen, protein C activity, protein S activity, and anti-thrombin III. Discontinue ERWINAZE for a thrombotic or hemorrhagic event until symptoms resolve; after resolution, treatment with ERWINAZE may be resumed.\n",

(5.2) \n *   Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: Manage with immediate discontinuation and close monitoring. (5.3) \n *   Tardive Dyskinesia: Discontinue if clinically appropriate. (5.4) \n * dispatch: unexpected key: list in dispatch table: {'caption': <function print_caption at 0x1c6c8c0>, 'text': <function print_text at 0x1c6c500>}\n  Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. (5.5) \n *   Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been observed. (5.6) \n *   Orthostatic Hypotension, Syncope, and Other Hemodynamic Effects: Dizziness, tachycardia or bradycardia, and syncope may occur, especially early in treatment. Use with caution in patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, and in antipsychotic-naive patients. (5.7) \n *   Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis have been reported with antipsychotics. Patients with a pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or a history of leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and SAPHRIS should be discontinued at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. (5.8) \n *   QT Prolongation: Increases in QT interval; avoid use with drugs that also increase the QT interval and in patients with risk factors for prolonged QT interval. (5.9) \n *   Seizures: Use cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. (5.11) \n *   Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment: Use caution when operating machinery. (5.12) \n *   Suicide: The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Closely supervise high-risk patients. (5.14) \n    \n       5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\n\n      Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in the drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times that seen in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. SAPHRIS is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis  [seeBoxed Warningand Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]  .\n\n\n\n       5.2 Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke, In Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\n\n      In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks) including fatalities compared to placebo-treated subjects. SAPHRIS is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis  [see alsoBoxed Warningand Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  .\n\n\n\n       5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome\n\n      A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including SAPHRIS. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.\n\n\n\n     The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g. pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.\n\n\n\n     The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.\n\n\n\n     If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.\n\n\n\n       5.4 Tardive Dyskinesia\n\n      A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements can develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) is unknown.\n\n\n\n     The risk of developing TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.\n\n\n\n     There is no known treatment for established cases of TD, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.\n\n\n\n     Given these considerations, SAPHRIS should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of TD. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.\n\n\n\n     If signs and symptoms of TD appear in a patient on SAPHRIS, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with SAPHRIS despite the presence of the syndrome.\n\n\n\n       5.5 Metabolic Changes\n\n      Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.\n\n\n\n         Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus  \n\n\n\n     Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics included in these studies. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.\n\n\n\n     Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the antipsychotic drug.\n\n\n\n       Adult Patients:  Pooled data from the short-term placebo-controlled schizophrenia and bipolar mania trials are presented in  Table 1.  \n\n\n\n TABLE 1: Changes in

To adjust for normal growth, z-scores were derived (measured in standard deviations [SD]), which normalize for the natural growth of pediatric patients by comparisons to age- and sex-matched population standards.\n \n\n     The distance of a z-score from 0 represents the distance of a percentile from the median, measured in standard deviations (SD). After adjusting for age and sex, the mean change from baseline to endpoint in weight z-score for SAPHRS 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily, was 0.11, 0.08 and 0.09 SD versus 0.02 SD for placebo, respectively.\n\n\n\n     When treating pediatric patients, weight gain should be monitored and assessed against that expected for normal growth.\n\n\n\n Table 7: Change in Body Weight in Pediatric Subjects from Baseline \n  N* = Number of subjects who had assessments at both Baseline and Endpoint.    \n  \n                   Bipolar I Disorder (3-weeks)   \n Placebo           SAPHRIS2.5 mgtwice daily  SAPHRIS5 mgtwice daily  SAPHRIS10 mgtwice daily   \n Change from Baseline (kg) (N*)  0.5(89)              1.7(92)                1.6(90)               1.4(87)                 \n                   Proportion of Subjects with a >=7% Increase in Body Weight   \n % with >=7% increase in body weight  1.1%                 12.0%                  8.9%                  8.0%                    \n                 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n       Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in patients treated with SAPHRIS. In several cases, these reactions occurred after the first dose. These hypersensitivity reactions included: anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypotension, tachycardia, swollen tongue, dyspnea, wheezing and rash.\n\n\n\n       5.7 Orthostatic Hypotension, Syncope, and Other Hemodynamic Effects\n\n      SAPHRIS may induce orthostatic hypotension and syncope in some patients, especially early in treatment, because of its alpha1-adrenergic antagonist activity. In short-term schizophrenia adult trials, syncope was reported in 0.2% (1/572) of patients treated with therapeutic doses (5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) of SAPHRIS, compared to 0.3% (1/378) of patients treated with placebo. In short-term bipolar mania adult trials, syncope was reported in 0.3% (1/379) of patients treated with therapeutic doses (5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) of SAPHRIS, compared to 0% (0/203) of patients treated with placebo. During adult pre-marketing clinical trials with SAPHRIS, including long-term trials without comparison to placebo, syncope was reported in 0.6% (11/1953) of patients treated with SAPHRIS. In a 3-week, bipolar mania pediatric trial, syncope was reported in 1% (1/104) of patients treated with SAPHRIS 2.5 mg twice daily, 1% (1/99) of patients treated with SAPHRIS 5 mg twice daily, and 0% (0/99) for patients treated with SAPHRIS 10 mg twice daily compared to 0% (0/101) for patients treated with placebo.\n\n\n\n     Patients should be instructed about non-pharmacologic interventions that help to reduce the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension (e.g., sitting on the edge of the bed for several minutes before attempting to stand in the morning and slowly rising from a seated position). SAPHRIS should be used with caution in (1) patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications); and (2) in the elderly. SAPHRIS should be used cautiously when treating patients who receive treatment with other drugs that can induce hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory or central nervous system depression  [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]  . Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in all such patients, and a dose reduction should be considered if hypotension occurs.\n\n\n\n       5.8 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis\n\n      In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including SAPHRIS. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in the class.\n\n\n\n     Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a pre-existing low WBC/ANC or drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of SAPHRIS at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.\n\n\n\n     Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue SAPHRIS in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm  3  ) and follow their WBC until recovery.\n\n\n\n       5.9 QT Prolongation\n\n      The effects of SAPHRIS on the QT/QTc interval were evaluated in a dedicated adult QT study. This trial involved SAPHRIS doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg twice daily, and placebo, and was conducted in 151 clinically stable patients with schizophrenia, with electrocardiographic assessments throughout the dosing interval at baseline and steady state. At these doses, SAPHRIS was associated with increases in QTc interval ranging from 2 to 5 msec compared to placebo. No patients treated with SAPHRIS experienced QTc increases >=60 msec from baseline measurements, nor did any patient experience a QTc of >=500 msec.\n\n\n\n     Electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements were taken at various time points during the SAPHRIS clinical trial program (5 mg or 10 mg twice daily doses). Post-baseline QT prolongations exceeding 500 msec were reported at comparable rates for SAPHRIS and placebo in these short-term trials. There were no reports of Torsade de Pointes or any other adverse reactions associated with delayed ventricular repolarization.\n\n\n\n     The use of SAPHRIS should be avoided in combination with other drugs known to prolong QTc including Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class 3 antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), and antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin). SAPHRIS should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias and in other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including bradycardia; hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; and presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval.\n\n\n\n       5.10 Hyperprolactinemia\n\n      Like other drugs that antagonize dopamine D2receptors, SAPHRIS can elevate prolactin levels, and the elevation can persist during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects. In SAPHRIS adult clinical trials, the incidences of adverse events related to abnormal prolactin levels were 0.4% versus 0% for placebo. In a 3-week, bipolar mania pediatric trial, the incidence of adverse events related to abnormal prolactin levels were 0% in the SAPHRIS 2.5 mg twice daily treatment group, 2% in the SAPHRIS 5 mg twice daily treatment group, and 1% in the SAPHRIS 10 mg twice daily treatment group versus to 1% for patients treated with placebo  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .\n\n\n\n     Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent  in vitro  , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously-detected breast cancer. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive.\n\n\n\n       5.11 Seizures\n\n      Seizures were reported in 0% and 0.3% (0/572, 1/379) of adult patients treated with doses of 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily of SAPHRIS, respectively, compared to 0% (0/503, 0/203) of patients treated with placebo in short-term schizophrenia and bipolar mania trials, respectively. During adult pre-marketing clinical trials with SAPHRIS, including long-term trials without comparison to placebo, seizures were reported in 0.3% (5/1953) of patients treated with SAPHRIS. There were no reports of seizures in pediatric patients treated with SAPHRIS in a 3-week-term, bipolar mania trial.\n\n\n\n     As with other antipsychotic drugs, SAPHRIS should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in patients 65 years or older.\n\n\n\n       5.12 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment\n\n      Somnolence was reported in patients treated with SAPHRIS. It was usually transient with the highest incidence reported during the first week of treatment. In short-term, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled schizophrenia adult trials, somnolence was reported in 15% (41/274) of patients on SAPHRIS 5 mg twice daily and in 13% (26/208) of patients on SAPHRIS 10 mg twice daily compared to 7% (26/378) of placebo patients. In short-term, placebo-controlled bipolar mania adult trials of therapeutic doses (5-10 mg twice daily), somnolence was reported in 24% (90/379) of patients on SAPHRIS compared to 6% (13/203) of placebo patients. During adult pre-marketing clinical trials with SAPHRIS, including long-term trials without comparison to placebo, somnolence was reported in 18% (358/1953) of patients treated with SAPHRIS. Somnolence (including sedation) led to discontinuation in 0.6% (12/1953) of patients in short-term, placebo-controlled trials.\n\n\n\n     In a 3-week, placebo-controlled, bipolar I pediatric trial, the incidence of somnolence (including sedation and hypersomnia) for placebo, SAPHRIS 2.5 mg twice daily, 5 mg twice daily, and 10 mg twice daily, was 12% (12/101), 46% (48/104), 53% (52/99), and 49% (49/99), respectively. Somnolence led to discontinuation in 0%, 3%, 1%, and 2% of patients treated with placebo, and SAPHRIS 2.5 mg twice daily, 5 mg twice daily, and 10 mg twice daily, respectively.\n\n\n\n     Patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating hazardous machinery or operating a motor vehicle, until they are reasonably certain that SAPHRIS therapy does not affect them adversely.\n\n\n\n       5.13 Body Temperature Regulation\n\n      Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. In the short-term placebo-controlled trials for both schizophrenia and acute bipolar disorder, the incidence of adverse reactions suggestive of body temperature increases was low (<=1%) and comparable to placebo (0%). During clinical trials with SAPHRIS, including long-term trials without comparison to placebo, the incidence of adverse reactions suggestive of body temperature increases (pyrexia and feeling hot) was <=1%.\n\n\n\n     Appropriate care is advised when prescribing SAPHRIS for patients who will be experiencing conditions that may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration.\n\n\n\n       5.14 Suicide\n\n      The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illnesses and bipolar disorder, and close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for SAPHRIS should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose.\n\n\n\n       5.15 Dysphagia\n\n  Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Dysphagia was reported in 0.2% and 0% (1/572, 0/379) of patients treated with therapeutic doses (5-10 mg twice daily) of SAPHRIS as compared to 0% (0/378, 0/203) of patients treated with placebo in short-term schizophrenia and bipolar mania adult trials, respectively. During adult pre-marketing clinical trials with SAPHRIS, including long-term trials without comparison to placebo, dysphagia was reported in 0.1% (2/1953) of patients treated with SAPHRIS.\n\n\n\n     Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. SAPHRIS is not indicated for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis, and should not be used in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia  [see also Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  .\n\n\n\n       5.16 Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness\n\n      Clinical experience with SAPHRIS in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  .\n\n\n\n     SAPHRIS has not been evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from pre-marketing clinical trials. Because of the risk of orthostatic hypotension with SAPHRIS, caution should be observed in cardiac patients  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]  .\n",

Prolonged exposure to elevated plasma ammonia levels can rapidly result in injury to the brain or death.  Prompt use of all therapies necessary to reduce plasma ammonia levels is essential. (  5.1  ) Therapeutic Monitoring  :  Plasma ammonia levels should be maintained within normal range for age via individual dose adjustment.

Treatment of hyperammonemia may require dialysis, preferably hemodialysis, to remove a large burden of ammonia.  Uncontrolled hyperammonemia can rapidly result in brain injury/damage or death, and prompt use of all therapies necessary to reduce plasma ammonia levels is essential.  \n\n\n\n  Management of hyperammonemia due to NAGS deficiency should be done in coordination with medical personnel experienced in metabolic disorders.  Ongoing monitoring of plasma ammonia levels, neurological status, laboratory tests and clinical responses in patients receiving Carbaglu is crucial to assess patient response to treatment.  \n\n\n\n  5.2    Therapeutic Monitoring  \n\n\n\n Plasma ammonia levels should be maintained within normal range for age via individual dose adjustment.\n\n\n\n  5.3    Nutritional Management  \n\n\n\n Since hyperammonemia is the result of protein catabolism, complete protein restriction is recommended to be maintained for 24 to 48 hours and caloric supplementation should be maximized to reverse catabolism and nitrogen turnover.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function before and during therapy. (  5.2  ) \n *    Thrombotic/Thromboembolic Complications: Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease receiving PROMACTA. Monitor platelet counts regularly. (  5.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hepatic Decompensation in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C\n\n\n\n  In patients with chronic hepatitis C, PROMACTA in combination with interferon and ribavirin may increase the risk of hepatic decompensation. In two controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C and thrombocytopenia, ascites and encephalopathy occurred more frequently on the arm receiving treatment with PROMACTA plus antivirals (7%) than the placebo plus antivirals arm (4%). Patients with low albumin levels (less than 3.5 g/dL) or Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score greater than or equal to 10 at baseline had a greater risk for hepatic decompensation on the arm receiving treatment with PROMACTA plus antivirals. Discontinue PROMACTA if antiviral therapy is discontinued.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Hepatotoxicity\n\n\n\n  PROMACTA can cause liver enzyme elevations [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  . Measure serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to initiation of PROMACTA, every 2 weeks during the dose adjustment phase, and monthly following establishment of a stable dose. PROMACTA inhibits UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1 and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, which may lead to indirect hyperbilirubinemia. If bilirubin is elevated, perform fractionation. Evaluate abnormal serum liver tests with repeat testing within 3 to 5 days. If the abnormalities are confirmed, monitor serum liver tests weekly until resolved or stabilized. Discontinue PROMACTA if ALT levels increase to greater than or equal to 3 x ULN in patients with normal liver function or greater than or equal to 3 x baseline in patients with pre-treatment elevations in transaminases and are:\n\n\n\n *    progressively increasing, or \n *    persistent for greater than or equal to 4 weeks, or \n *    accompanied by increased direct bilirubin, or \n *    accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury or evidence for hepatic decompensation. \n    If the potential benefit for reinitiating treatment with PROMACTA is considered to outweigh the risk for hepatotoxicity, then consider cautiously reintroducing PROMACTA and measure serum liver tests weekly during the dose adjustment phase. Hepatotoxicity may reoccur if PROMACTA is reinitiated. If liver test abnormalities persist, worsen or recur, then permanently discontinue PROMACTA.\n \n\n    5.3 Thrombotic/Thromboembolic Complications\n\n\n\n  In two controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C and thrombocytopenia, 3% (31/955) treated with PROMACTA experienced a thrombotic event compared with 1% (5/484) on placebo. The majority of events were of the portal venous system (1% in patients treated with PROMACTA versus less than 1% for placebo).\n\n\n\n Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications may result from increases in platelet counts with PROMACTA. Reported thrombotic/thromboembolic complications included both venous and arterial events and were observed at low and at normal platelet counts.\n\n\n\n Consider the potential for an increased risk of thromboembolism when administering PROMACTA to patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism (e.g., Factor V Leiden, ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome, chronic liver disease). To minimize the risk for thrombotic/thromboembolic complications, do not use PROMACTA in an attempt to normalize platelet counts. Follow the dose adjustment guidelines to achieve and maintain target platelet counts [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2, 2.3)]  .\n\n\n\n In a controlled trial in patients with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia not related to ITP undergoing elective invasive procedures (N = 292), the risk of thrombotic events was increased in patients treated with 75 mg of PROMACTA once daily. Seven thrombotic complications (six patients) were reported in the group that received PROMACTA and three thrombotic complications were reported in the placebo group (two patients). All of the thrombotic complications reported in the group that received PROMACTA were portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Symptoms of PVT included abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Five of the six patients in the group that received PROMACTA experienced a thrombotic complication within 30 days of completing treatment with PROMACTA and at a platelet count above 200 x 10  9  /L. The risk of portal venous thrombosis was increased in thrombocytopenic patients with chronic liver disease treated with 75 mg of PROMACTA once daily for 2 weeks in preparation for invasive procedures.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Cataracts\n\n\n\n  In the three controlled clinical trials in adults with chronic ITP, cataracts developed or worsened in 15 (7%) patients who received 50 mg of PROMACTA daily and 8 (7%) placebo-group patients. In the extension trial, cataracts developed or worsened in 4% of patients who underwent ocular examination prior to therapy with PROMACTA. In the two controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C and thrombocytopenia, cataracts developed or worsened in 8% patients treated with PROMACTA and 5% patients treated with placebo.\n\n\n\n Cataracts were observed in toxicology studies of eltrombopag in rodents [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)]  . Perform a baseline ocular examination prior to administration of PROMACTA and, during therapy with PROMACTA, regularly monitor patients for signs and symptoms of cataracts.\n",

Blood pressure should be well-controlled prior to initiating INLYTA. Monitor for hypertension and treat as needed. For persistent hypertension despite use of anti-hypertensive medications, reduce the INLYTA dose. (5.1) \n *  Arterial and venous thrombotic events have been observed and can be fatal. Use with caution in patients who are at increased risk for these events. (5.2,5.3) \n *  Hemorrhagic events, including fatal events, have been reported. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with evidence of untreated brain metastasis or recent active gastrointestinal bleeding and should not be used in those patients. (5.4) \n *  Cardiac failure has been observed and can be fatal. Monitor for signs or symptoms of cardiac failure throughout treatment with INLYTA. (5.5) \n *  Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula, including death, have occurred. Use with caution in patients at risk for gastrointestinal perforation or fistula. (5.6) \n *  Hypothyroidism requiring thyroid hormone replacement has been reported. Monitor thyroid function before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with INLYTA. (5.7) \n *  Stop INLYTA at least 24 hours prior to scheduled surgery. (5.8) \n *  Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has been observed. Permanently discontinue INLYTA if signs or symptoms of RPLS occur. (5.9) \n *  Monitor for proteinuria before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with INLYTA. For moderate to severe proteinuria, reduce the dose or temporarily interrupt treatment with INLYTA. (5.10) \n *  Liver enzyme elevation has been observed during treatment with INLYTA. Monitor ALT, AST and bilirubin before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with INLYTA. (5.11) \n *  The starting dose of INLYTA should be decreased if used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. (2.2,5.12) \n *  INLYTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving INLYTA. (5.13,8.1) \n    \n   5.1 Hypertension and Hypertensive Crisis\n\n  In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, hypertension was reported in 145/359 patients (40%) receiving INLYTA and 103/355 patients (29%) receiving sorafenib. Grade 3/4 hypertension was observed in 56/359 patients (16%) receiving INLYTA and 39/355 patients (11%) receiving sorafenib. Hypertensive crisis was reported in 2/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib. The median onset time for hypertension (systolic blood pressure >150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >100 mmHg) was within the first month of the start of INLYTA treatment and blood pressure increases have been observed as early as 4 days after starting INLYTA. Hypertension was managed with standard antihypertensive therapy. Discontinuation of INLYTA treatment due to hypertension occurred in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib  [seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)].  \n\n\n\n Blood pressure should be well-controlled prior to initiating INLYTA. Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with standard anti-hypertensive therapy. In the case of persistent hypertension despite use of anti-hypertensive medications, reduce the INLYTA dose. Discontinue INLYTA if hypertension is severe and persistent despite anti-hypertensive therapy and dose reduction of INLYTA, and discontinuation should be considered if there is evidence of hypertensive crisis. If INLYTA is interrupted, patients receiving antihypertensive medications should be monitored for hypotension  [seeDosage and Administration (2.2)].  \n\n\n\n   5.2 Arterial Thromboembolic Events\n\n  In clinical trials, arterial thromboembolic events have been reported, including deaths. In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, Grade 3/4 arterial thromboembolic events were reported in 4/359 patients (1%) receiving INLYTA and 4/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. Fatal cerebrovascular accident was reported in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib  [seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)]  .\n\n\n\n In clinical trials with INLYTA, arterial thromboembolic events (including transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, and retinal artery occlusion) were reported in 17/715 patients (2%), with two deaths secondary to cerebrovascular accident.\n\n\n\n Use INLYTA with caution in patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of, these events. INLYTA has not been studied in patients who had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 12 months.\n\n\n\n   5.3 Venous Thromboembolic Events\n\n  In clinical trials, venous thromboembolic events have been reported, including deaths. In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, venous thromboembolic events were reported in 11/359 patients (3%) receiving INLYTA and 2/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. Grade 3/4 venous thromboembolic events were reported in 9/359 patients (3%) receiving INLYTA (including pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, retinal vein occlusion and retinal vein thrombosis) and 2/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. Fatal pulmonary embolism was reported in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib. In clinical trials with INLYTA, venous thromboembolic events were reported in 22/715 patients (3%), with two deaths secondary to pulmonary embolism.\n\n\n\n Use INLYTA with caution in patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of, these events. INLYTA has not been studied in patients who had a venous thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months.\n\n\n\n   5.4 Hemorrhage\n\n  In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, hemorrhagic events were reported in 58/359 patients (16%) receiving INLYTA and 64/355 patients (18%) receiving sorafenib. Grade 3/4 hemorrhagic events were reported in 5/359 (1%) patients receiving INLYTA (including cerebral hemorrhage, hematuria, hemoptysis, lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and melena) and 11/355 (3%) patients receiving sorafenib. Fatal hemorrhage was reported in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA (gastric hemorrhage) and 3/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib.\n\n\n\n INLYTA has not been studied in patients who have evidence of untreated brain metastasis or recent active gastrointestinal bleeding and should not be used in those patients. If any bleeding requires medical intervention, temporarily interrupt the INLYTA dose.\n\n\n\n   5.5 Cardiac Failure\n\n    In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, cardiac failure was reported in 6/359 patients (2%) receiving INLYTA and 3/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. Grade 3/4 cardiac failure was observed in 2/359 patients (1%) receiving INLYTA and 1/355 patients (<1%) receiving sorafenib. Fatal cardiac failure was reported in 2/359 patients (1%) receiving INLYTA and 1/355 patients (<1%) receiving sorafenib. Monitor for signs or symptoms of cardiac failure throughout treatment with INLYTA. Management of cardiac failure may require permanent discontinuation of INLYTA.  \n\n\n\n   5.6 Gastrointestinal Perforation and Fistula Formation\n\n  In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, gastrointestinal perforation was reported in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib. In clinical trials with INLYTA, gastrointestinal perforation was reported in 5/715 patients (1%), including one death. In addition to cases of gastrointestinal perforation, fistulas were reported in 4/715 patients (1%).\n\n\n\n Monitor for symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula periodically throughout treatment with INLYTA.\n\n\n\n   5.7 Thyroid Dysfunction\n\n  In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, hypothyroidism was reported in 69/359 patients (19%) receiving INLYTA and 29/355 patients (8%) receiving sorafenib. Hyperthyroidism was reported in 4/359 patients (1%) receiving INLYTA and 4/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. In patients who had thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) <5 muU/mL before treatment, elevations of TSH to >=10 muU/mL occurred in 79/245 patients (32%) receiving INLYTA and 25/232 patients (11%) receiving sorafenib  [seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)].  \n\n\n\n Monitor thyroid function before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with INLYTA. Treat hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism according to standard medical practice to maintain euthyroid state.\n\n\n\n   5.8 Wound Healing Complications\n\n  No formal studies of the effect of INLYTA on wound healing have been conducted.\n\n\n\n Stop treatment with INLYTA at least 24 hours prior to scheduled surgery. The decision to resume INLYTA therapy after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing.\n\n\n\n   5.9 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome\n\n  In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) was reported in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib  [seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)]  . There were two additional reports of RPLS in other clinical trials with INLYTA.\n\n\n\n RPLS is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of RPLS. Discontinue INLYTA in patients developing RPLS. The safety of reinitiating INLYTA therapy in patients previously experiencing RPLS is not known.\n\n\n\n   5.10 Proteinuria\n\n  In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, proteinuria was reported in 39/359 patients (11%) receiving INLYTA and 26/355 patients (7%) receiving sorafenib. Grade 3 proteinuria was reported in 11/359 patients (3%) receiving INLYTA and 6/355 patients (2%) receiving sorafenib  [seeAdverse Reactions (6.1)].  \n\n\n\n Monitoring for proteinuria before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with INLYTA is recommended. For patients who develop moderate to severe proteinuria, reduce the dose or temporarily interrupt INLYTA treatment.\n\n\n\n   5.11 Elevation of Liver Enzymes\n\n  In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations of all grades occurred in 22% of patients on both arms, with Grade 3/4 events in <1% of patients on the INLYTA arm and 2% of patients on the sorafenib arm.\n\n\n\n Monitor ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment with INLYTA.\n\n\n\n   5.12 Hepatic Impairment\n\n  The systemic exposure to axitinib was higher in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. A dose decrease is recommended when administering INLYTA to patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B). INLYTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C)  [seeDosage and Administration (2.2),Use in Specific Populations (8.6), andClinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  \n\n\n\n   5.13 Pregnancy\n\n  INLYTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using INLYTA. In developmental toxicity studies in mice, axitinib was teratogenic, embryotoxic and fetotoxic at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the recommended clinical dose.\n\n\n\n Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving INLYTA. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus  [seeUse in Specific Populations (8.1)].  \n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  NORTHERA can cause supine hypertension and may increase cardiovascular risk if supine hypertension is not well-managed (  5.1  ). \n *  Hyperpyrexia and confusion (  5.2  ) \n *  May exacerbate symptoms in patients with existing ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure (  5.3  ) \n *  Allergic reactions (  5.4  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Supine Hypertension\n\n\n\n  NORTHERA therapy may cause or exacerbate supine hypertension in patients with NOH. Patients should be advised to elevate the head of the bed when resting or sleeping. Monitor blood pressure, both in the supine position and in the recommended head-elevated sleeping position. Reduce or discontinue NORTHERA if supine hypertension persists. If supine hypertension is not well-managed, NORTHERA may increase the risk of cardiovascular events.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Hyperpyrexia and Confusion\n\n\n\n  Post-marketing cases of a symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been reported with NORTHERA use during post-marketing surveillance in Japan.  Observe patients carefully when the dosage of NORTHERA is changed or when concomitant levodopa is reduced abruptly or discontinued, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics.\n\n\n\n NMS is an uncommon but life-threatening syndrome characterized by fever or hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness, and mental status changes.  The early diagnosis of this condition is important for the appropriate management of these patients.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Ischemic Heart Disease, Arrhythmias, and Congestive Heart Failure\n\n\n\n  NORTHERA may exacerbate existing ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure.  Careful consideration should be given to this potential risk prior to initiating therapy in patients with these conditions.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Allergic Reactions\n\n\n\n  This product contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.\n",
