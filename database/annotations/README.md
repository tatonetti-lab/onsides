## OnSIDES-ANNOT (Dataset of Manually Annotated ADEs in Drug Labels)

This is a dataset of 200 randomly sampled labels for each of the UK, EU, Japan drug labels, and 200 randomly sampled labels for the pediatric sections in the US drug labels, and manually reviewed and annotated the adverse drug events mentioned in these drug labels. This is presented alongside the [Denmer-Fushman et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20181) data set, which insipired these efforts.

For the generation methodology and technical formatting of these files, please refer to [OnSIDES-ANNOT ANNOTATION.md](https://github.com/tatonetti-lab/onsides/blob/main/onsides_annot/ANNOTATION.md).

**Of Note**

While we have made our best efforts to ensure its accuracy, this dataset has not been validated by a medical professional, and is still in active development / review. Any errors found in the dataset will be noted here, and the latest dataset can be found in this repository. We hope to add further annotated datasets in the near future to facilitate further methods development in this domain.

If you find an error in the data, or have any suggestions on how to improve this dataset,  please raise an issue in this repository or contact Dr. Tatonetti via [email](https://tatonettilab.org/people/) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nicktatonetti).
