        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Embryo-Fetal Toxicity. Do not use in pregnant women. Obtain a urine or serum pregnancy test prior to initiation of therapy. Advise use of effective contraception in females of reproductive potential (  Boxed Warning  ,  5.1  ,  8.1  ,  8.8  ,  13.1  ). \n *    Reproductive effects. Miltefosine caused testicular atrophy and impaired fertility in male rats and impaired fertility in female rats. Advise patients of reproductive toxicities in animal studies and that the potential effects on human fertility have not been adequately evaluated (  13.1  ). \n *    Renal Effects. Monitor serum creatinine during therapy and for 4 weeks after end of therapy (  5.3  ,  6.1  ). \n *    Hepatic Effects. Monitor transaminases and bilirubin during therapy (  5.4  ,  6.1  ). \n *    Gastrointestinal Effects. Encourage fluid intake (  5.5  ). \n *    Thrombocytopenia. Monitor platelet count during therapy for visceral leishmaniasis (  5.6  ,  6.1  ). \n *    Absorption of Oral Contraceptives. Advise use of alternative method of contraception if vomiting and/or diarrhea occur (  5.7  ). \n *    Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Discontinue IMPAVIDO (  5.8  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Miltefosine may cause fetal harm. Embryo-fetal toxicity, including death and teratogenicity, was observed in animals administered miltefosine prior to mating, during early pregnancy, and during organogenesis at doses lower than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Do not use IMPAVIDO in pregnant women. Obtain a urine or serum pregnancy test prior to prescribing IMPAVIDO to females of reproductive potential. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IMPAVIDO therapy and for 5 months after completion of therapy [see  Boxed Warning  , Contraindications (  4.1  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.8  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Reproductive Effects\n\n\n\n   Females  \n\n\n\n Miltefosine caused impaired fertility in rats and reversible follicular atresia and diestrus in dogs at doses approximately 1.0 and 0.2 times respectively the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons [see Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.1  )]  . Effects on human female fertility have not been formally studied.\n\n\n\n  Males  \n\n\n\n Miltefosine caused reduced viable sperm counts and impaired fertility in rats at doses approximately 0.4 times the MRHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.1    ) ]  . A higher dose in rats, approximately 1.0 times the MRHD, caused testicular atrophy and impaired fertility that did not fully reverse 10 weeks after drug administration ended.\n\n\n\n Scrotal pain and decreased or absent ejaculation during therapy have been reported during IMPAVIDO therapy [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2    ) ]  . The effects of IMPAVIDO on human male fertility have not been adequately studied.\n\n\n\n Advise women and men of the animal fertility findings, and that the potential for impaired fertility with IMPAVIDO therapy in humans has not been adequately evaluated.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Renal Effects\n\n\n\n  Elevations of serum creatinine (Cr) were noted in clinical trials evaluating IMPAVIDO in the treatment of cutaneous, mucosal and visceral leishmaniasis. Monitor renal function weekly in patients receiving IMPAVIDO during therapy and for 4 weeks after end of therapy [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4 Hepatic Effects\n\n\n\n  Elevations in liver transaminases (ALT, AST) and bilirubin were noted in clinical trials evaluating IMPAVIDO in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. Monitor liver transaminases (ALT, AST) and bilirubin during therapy in patients receiving IMPAVIDO [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Gastrointestinal Effects\n\n\n\n  Vomiting and/or diarrhea commonly occur during IMPAVIDO administration and may result in volume depletion. Encourage fluid intake to avoid volume depletion [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.6 Thrombocytopenia\n\n\n\n  Thrombocytopenia during therapy has been reported in patients treated for visceral leishmaniasis. Monitor platelet count during therapy for visceral leishmaniasis [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ,  6.2  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.7 Absorption of Oral Contraceptives\n\n\n\n  Vomiting and/or diarrhea occurring during IMPAVIDO therapy may affect the absorption of oral contraceptives, and therefore compromise their efficacy. If vomiting and/or diarrhea occur during IMPAVIDO therapy, advise females to use additional non-hormonal or alternative method(s) of effective contraception.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Stevens-Johnson Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been reported during IMPAVIDO therapy. Discontinue IMPAVIDO if an exfoliative or bullous rash is noted during therapy [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *   Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis): Risks increase in a dose-dependent manner, with advanced age (>=65), renal impairment, and inadequately treated hypothyroidism. Advise patients to promptly report unexplained and/or persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, and discontinue LIVALO (  5.1  ) \n *   Liver enzyme abnormalities: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Check liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter (  5.2  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Skeletal Muscle Effects\n\n\n\n   Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including LIVALO.  These risks can occur at any dose level, but increase in a dose-dependent manner.\n\n\n\n LIVALO should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy. These factors include advanced age (>=65 years), renal impairment, and inadequately treated hypothyroidism. The risk of myopathy may also be increased with concurrent administration of fibrates or lipid-modifying doses of niacin. LIVALO should be administered with caution in patients with impaired renal function, in elderly patients, or when used concomitantly with fibrates or lipid-modifying doses of niacin [see Drug Interactions (  7.6  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ,  8.6  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].  \n\n\n\n Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing LIVALO with colchicine [see Drug Interactions  (  7.7  )].\n\n\n\n There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use.  IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation; improvement with immunosuppressive agents.\n\n\n\n LIVALO therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. LIVALO therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of myopathy or predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis, hypotension, dehydration, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled seizures). All patients should be advised to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing LIVALO.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Liver Enzyme Abnormalities\n\n\n\n  Increases in serum transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]/serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, or alanine aminotransferase [ALT]/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase) have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including LIVALO. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy.\n\n\n\n In placebo-controlled Phase 2 studies, ALT >3 times the upper limit of normal was not observed in the placebo, LIVALO 1 mg, or LIVALO 2 mg groups. One out of 202 patients (0.5%) administered LIVALO 4 mg had ALT >3 times the upper limit of normal.\n\n\n\n It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before the initiation of LIVALO and if signs or symptoms of liver injury occur.\n\n\n\n There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including pitavastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with LIVALO, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found do not restart LIVALO.\n\n\n\n As with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, LIVALO should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. Active liver disease, which may include unexplained persistent transaminase elevations, is a contraindication to the use of LIVALO [see Contraindications (  4  )].  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Endocrine Function\n\n\n\n  Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including LIVALO.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Periodically reevaluate the benefit and potential for adverse effects such as worsening mood, cognition, rigidity, and functional capacity (  5.1  ) \n *    Do not exceed 50 mg/day and the maximum single dose should not exceed 25 mg if administered in conjunction with a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine) (  5.3  ,  7.1  ) \n *    Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Discontinue if this occurs (  5.4  ,  7.6  ) \n *    Restlessness, agitation, akathisia and parkinsonism: Reduce dose or discontinue if occurs (  5.5  ,  5.6  ) \n *    Dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia: Monitor for dysphagia (  5.7  ) \n *    Sedation/Somnolence: May impair patient's ability to drive or operate complex machinery (  5.8  ) \n *    QTc prolongation: Not recommended in combination with other drugs that prolong QTc (  5.9  ) \n *    Exaggerates extrapyramidal disorders when used with drugs that reduce or antagonize dopamine. Discontinue XENAZINE if this occurs (  5.12  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Clinical Worsening and Adverse Effects\n\n\n\n  Huntington's disease is a progressive disorder characterized by changes in mood, cognition, chorea, rigidity, and functional capacity over time. In a 12-week controlled trial, XENAZINE was also shown to cause slight worsening in mood, cognition, rigidity, and functional capacity. Whether these effects persist, resolve, or worsen with continued treatment is unknown.\n\n\n\n Prescribers should periodically re-evaluate the need for XENAZINE in their patients by assessing the beneficial effect on chorea and possible adverse effects, including depression, cognitive decline, parkinsonism, dysphagia, sedation/somnolence, akathisia, restlessness and disability. It may be difficult to distinguish between drug-induced side-effects and progression of the underlying disease; decreasing the dose or stopping the drug may help the clinician distinguish between the two possibilities. In some patients, underlying chorea itself may improve over time, decreasing the need for XENAZINE.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Depression and Suicidality\n\n\n\n  Patients with Huntington's disease are at increased risk for depression, suicidal ideation or behaviors (suicidality). XENAZINE increases the risk for suicidality in patients with HD. All patients treated with XENAZINE should be observed for new or worsening depression or suicidality. If depression or suicidality does not resolve, consider discontinuing treatment with XENAZINE.\n\n\n\n In a 12-week, double-blind placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with Huntington's disease, 10 of 54 patients (19%) treated with XENAZINE were reported to have an adverse event of depression or worsening depression compared to none of the 30 placebo-treated patients. In two open-label studies (in one study, 29 patients received XENAZINE for up to 48 weeks; in the second study, 75 patients received XENAZINE for up to 80 weeks), the rate of depression/worsening depression was 35%.\n\n\n\n In all of the HD chorea studies of XENAZINE (n=187), one patient committed suicide, one attempted suicide, and six had suicidal ideation.\n\n\n\n Clinicians should be alert to the heightened risk of suicide in patients with Huntington's disease regardless of depression indices. Reported rates of completed suicide among individuals with Huntington's disease ranged from 3-13% and over 25% of patients attempt suicide at some point in their illness.\n\n\n\n Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the risks of depression, worsening depression, and suicidality associated with XENAZINE and should be instructed to report behaviors of concern promptly to the treating physician. Patients with HD who express suicidal ideation should be evaluated immediately.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Laboratory Tests\n\n\n\n  Before prescribing a daily dose of XENAZINE that is greater than 50 mg per day, patients should be genotyped to determine if they express the drug metabolizing enzyme, CYP2D6. CYP2D6 testing is necessary to determine whether patients are poor metabolizers (PMs), extensive (EMs) or intermediate metabolizers (IMs) of XENAZINE.\n\n\n\n Patients who are PMs of XENAZINE will have substantially higher levels of the primary drug metabolites (about 3-fold for alpha-HTBZ and 9-fold for beta-HTBZ) than patients who are EMs. The dosage should be adjusted according to a patient's CYP2D6 metabolizer status. In patients who are identified as CYP2D6 PMs, the maximum recommended total daily dose is 50 mg and the maximum recommended single dose is 25 mg [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ,  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  , and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)\n\n\n\n  A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with XENAZINE and other drugs that reduce dopaminergic transmission [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.12)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.6)  ].  Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnosis of NMS can be complicated; other serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection), and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal disorders can present with similar signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.\n\n\n\n The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of XENAZINE and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and (3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.\n\n\n\n Recurrence of NMS has been reported. If treatment with XENAZINE is needed after recovery from NMS, patients should be monitored for signs of recurrence.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Akathisia, Restlessness, and Agitation\n\n\n\n  In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with HD, akathisia was observed in 10 (19%) of XENAZINE-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients. In an 80-week open-label study, akathisia was observed in 20% of XENAZINE-treated patients. Akathisia was not observed in a 48-week open-label study. Patients receiving XENAZINE should be monitored for the presence of akathisia. Patients receiving XENAZINE should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of restlessness and agitation, as these may be indicators of developing akathisia. If a patient develops akathisia, the XENAZINE dose should be reduced; however, some patients may require discontinuation of therapy.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Parkinsonism\n\n\n\n  XENAZINE can cause parkinsonism. In a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with HD, symptoms suggestive of parkinsonism (i.e., bradykinesia, hypertonia and rigidity) were observed in 15% of XENAZINE-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. In 48-week and 80-week open-label studies, symptoms suggestive of parkinsonism were observed in 10% and 3% of XENAZINE-treated patients, respectively. Because rigidity can develop as part of the underlying disease process in Huntington's disease, it may be difficult to distinguish between this drug-induced side-effect and progression of the underlying disease process. Drug-induced parkinsonism has the potential to cause more functional disability than untreated chorea for some patients with Huntington's disease. If a patient develops parkinsonism during treatment with XENAZINE, dose reduction should be considered; in some patients, discontinuation of therapy may be necessary.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Dysphagia\n\n\n\n  Dysphagia is a component of HD. However, drugs that reduce dopaminergic transmission have been associated with esophageal dysmotility and dysphagia. Dysphagia may be associated with aspiration pneumonia. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with HD, dysphagia was observed in 4% of XENAZINE-treated patients and 3% of placebo-treated patients. In 48-week and 80-week open-label studies, dysphagia was observed in 10% and 8% of XENAZINE-treated patients, respectively. Some of the cases of dysphagia were associated with aspiration pneumonia. Whether these events were related to treatment is unknown.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Sedation and Somnolence\n\n\n\n  Sedation is the most common dose-limiting adverse reaction of XENAZINE. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with chorea associated with HD, sedation/somnolence occurred in 17/54 (31%) XENAZINE-treated patients and in 1 (3%) placebo-treated patient. Sedation was the reason upward titration of XENAZINE was stopped and/or the dose of XENAZINE was decreased in 15/54 (28%) patients. In all but one case, decreasing the dose of XENAZINE resulted in decreased sedation. In 48-week and 80-week open-label studies, sedation/somnolence occurred in 17% and 57% of XENAZINE treated patients, respectively. In some patients, sedation occurred at doses that were lower than recommended doses.\n\n\n\n Patients should not perform activities requiring mental alertness to maintain the safety of themselves or others, such as operating a motor vehicle or operating hazardous machinery, until they are on a maintenance dose of XENAZINE and know how the drug affects them.\n\n\n\n    5.9 QTc Prolongation\n\n\n\n  XENAZINE causes a small increase (about 8 msec) in the corrected QT (QTc) interval. QT prolongation can lead to development of torsade de pointes-type ventricular tachycardia with the risk increasing as the degree of prolongation increases [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ].  The use of XENAZINE should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc, including antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperidol, thioridazine, ziprasidone), antibiotics (e.g., moxifloxacin), Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide), and Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications or any other medications known to prolong the QTc interval [see  Drug Interactions (7.5)  ].  \n\n\n\n XENAZINE should also be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including (1) bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.10 Hypotension and Orthostatic Hypotension\n\n\n\n  XENAZINE induced postural dizziness in healthy volunteers receiving single doses of 25 or 50 mg. One subject had syncope and one subject with postural dizziness had documented orthostasis. Dizziness occurred in 4% of XENAZINE-treated patients (vs. none on placebo) in the 12-week controlled trial; however, blood pressure was not measured during these events. Monitoring of vital signs on standing should be considered in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension.\n\n\n\n    5.11 Hyperprolactinemia\n\n\n\n  XENAZINE elevates serum prolactin concentrations in humans. Following administration of 25 mg to healthy volunteers, peak plasma prolactin levels increased 4- to 5-fold. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro  , a factor of potential importance if XENAZINE is being considered for a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although amenorrhea, galactorrhea, gynecomastia and impotence can be caused by elevated serum prolactin concentrations, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin concentrations for most patients is unknown. Chronic increase in serum prolactin levels (although not evaluated in the XENAZINE development program) has been associated with low levels of estrogen and increased risk of osteoporosis. If there is a clinical suspicion of symptomatic hyperprolactinemia, appropriate laboratory testing should be done and consideration should be given to discontinuation of XENAZINE.\n\n\n\n    5.12 Tardive Dyskinesia (TD)\n\n\n\n  A potentially irreversible syndrome of involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with neuroleptic drugs. In an animal model of orofacial dyskinesias, acute administration of reserpine, a monoamine depletor, has been shown to produce vacuous chewing in rats. Although the pathophysiology of tardive dyskinesia remains incompletely understood, the most commonly accepted hypothesis of the mechanism is that prolonged post-synaptic dopamine receptor blockade leads to supersensitivity to dopamine. Neither reserpine nor XENAZINE, which are dopamine depletors, have been reported to cause clear tardive dyskinesia in humans, but as pre-synaptic dopamine depletion could theoretically lead to supersensitivity to dopamine, and XENAZINE can cause the extrapyramidal symptoms also known to be associated with neuroleptics (e.g., parkinsonism and akathisia), physicians should be aware of the possible risk of tardive dyskinesia. If signs and symptoms of TD appear in a patient treated with XENAZINE, drug discontinuation should be considered.\n\n\n\n    5.13 Binding to Melanin-Containing Tissues\n\n\n\n  Since XENAZINE or its metabolites bind to melanin-containing tissues, it could accumulate in these tissues over time. This raises the possibility that XENAZINE may cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. Neither ophthalmologic nor microscopic examination of the eye was conducted in the chronic toxicity study in dogs. Ophthalmologic monitoring in humans was inadequate to exclude the possibility of injury occurring after long-term exposure.\n\n\n\n The clinical relevance of XENAZINE's binding to melanin-containing tissues is unknown. Although there are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmologic monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ].  \n",

Hold or stop LINZESS (  5.2  ) \n    \n \n\n      5.1 Pediatric Risk\n\n\n\n     LINZESS is contraindicated in children under 6 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of LINZESS in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established. In neonatal mice, increased fluid secretion as a consequence of GC-C agonism resulted in mortality within the first 24 hours due to dehydration. Due to increased intestinal expression of GC-C, children under 6 years of age may be more likely than older children and adults to develop significant diarrhea and its potentially serious consequences.\n\n\n\n    Avoid use of LINZESS in pediatric patients 6 through 17 years of age. Although there were no deaths in older juvenile mice, given the deaths in young juvenile mice and the lack of clinical safety and efficacy data in pediatric patients, avoid the use of LINZESS in pediatric patients 6 through 17 years of age [see Contraindications (  4  ), Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.4  ) and Nonclinical Toxicology (  13.2  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Diarrhea\n\n\n\n  Diarrhea was the most common adverse reaction of LINZESS-treated patients in the pooled IBS-C and CIC double-blind placebo-controlled trials. Severe diarrhea was reported in 2% of the LINZESS-treated patients. The incidence of diarrhea was similar between the IBS-C and CIC populations [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .\n\n\n\n    Instruct patients to stop LINZESS if severe diarrhea occurs and to contact their healthcare provider. The healthcare provider should consider dose suspension and rehydration [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .\n",

Obtain baseline liver enzymes and monitor as clinically indicated (  5.3  ). \n *  Decreases in hemoglobin (  5.4  ). \n *  Pulmonary edema in patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. If confirmed, discontinue treatment (  5.5  ). \n *  Decreases in sperm count have been observed in patients taking ERAs (  5.6  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Embryo-fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  OPSUMIT may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy and is contraindicated for use in females who are pregnant. In females of reproductive potential, exclude pregnancy prior to initiation of therapy, ensure use of acceptable contraceptive methods and obtain monthly pregnancy tests [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n OPSUMIT is available for females through the OPSUMIT REMS Program, a restricted distribution program [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 OPSUMIT REMS Program\n\n\n\n  For all females, OPSUMIT is available only through a restricted program called the OPSUMIT REMS Program, because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity [see  Contraindications (4.1)  ,  Warnings and Precautions (5.1)  , and  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Notable requirements of the OPSUMIT REMS Program include the following:\n\n\n\n *  Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training. \n *  All females, regardless of reproductive potential, must enroll in the OPSUMIT REMS Program prior to initiating OPSUMIT. Male patients are not enrolled in the REMS. \n *  Females of reproductive potential must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ] . \n *  Pharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive OPSUMIT. \n    Further information is available at www.OPSUMITREMS.com or 1-866-228-3546. Information on OPSUMIT certified pharmacies or wholesale distributors is available through Actelion Pathways at 1-866-228-3546.\n \n\n    5.3 Hepatotoxicity\n\n\n\n  Other ERAs have caused elevations of aminotransferases, hepatotoxicity, and liver failure. The incidence of elevated aminotransferases in the study of OPSUMIT in PAH is shown in Table 1.\n\n\n\n Table 1 Incidence of Elevated Aminotransferases in the SERAPHIN Study \n                                           OPSUMIT 10 mg(N=242)                  Placebo(N=249)             \n  \n >3 * ULN                                          3.4%                               4.5%                  \n >8 * ULN                                          2.1%                               0.4%                  \n         In the placebo-controlled study of OPSUMIT, discontinuations for hepatic adverse events were 3.3% in the OPSUMIT 10 mg group vs. 1.6% for placebo. Obtain liver enzyme tests prior to initiation of OPSUMIT and repeat during treatment as clinically indicated.\n \n\n Advise patients to report symptoms suggesting hepatic injury (nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, fever, or itching). If clinically relevant aminotransferase elevations occur, or if elevations are accompanied by an increase in bilirubin >2 * ULN, or by clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity, discontinue OPSUMIT. Consider re-initiation of OPSUMIT when hepatic enzyme levels normalize in patients who have not experienced clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Hemoglobin Decrease\n\n\n\n  Decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit have occurred following administration of other ERAs and were observed in clinical studies with OPSUMIT. These decreases occurred early and stabilized thereafter. In the placebo-controlled study of OPSUMIT in PAH, OPSUMIT 10 mg caused a mean decrease in hemoglobin from baseline to up to 18 months of about 1.0 g/dL compared to no change in the placebo group. A decrease in hemoglobin to below 10.0 g/dL was reported in 8.7% of the OPSUMIT 10 mg group and in 3.4% of the placebo group. Decreases in hemoglobin seldom require transfusion. Initiation of OPSUMIT is not recommended in patients with severe anemia. Measure hemoglobin prior to initiation of treatment and repeat during treatment as clinically indicated [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Pulmonary Edema with Pulmonary Veno-occlusive Disease (PVOD)\n\n\n\n  Should signs of pulmonary edema occur, consider the possibility of associated PVOD. If confirmed, discontinue OPSUMIT.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Decreased Sperm Counts\n\n\n\n  Other ERAs have caused adverse effects on spermatogenesis. Counsel men about potential effects on fertility [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  and  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  .\n",

(  5.2  ) \n *  Do not inject intra-perivascularily. (  5.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Anaphylaxis\n\n\n\n   Severe allergic reactions have been reported following polidocanol use, including anaphylactic reactions, some of them fatal. Severe reactions are more frequent with use of larger volumes (> 3 mL). The dose of polidocanol should therefore be minimized. Be prepared to treat anaphylaxis appropriately.  \n\n\n\n Severe adverse local effects, including tissue necrosis, may occur following extravasation; therefore, care should be taken in intravenous needle placement and the smallest effective volume at each injection site should be used.\n\n\n\n After the injection session is completed, apply compression with a stocking or bandage, and have the patient walk for 15-20 minutes. Keep the patient under supervision during this period to treat any anaphylactic or allergic reaction (see  Dosage and Administration [2]  )  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Accidental Intra-arterial Injection\n\n\n\n  Intra-arterial injection can cause severe necrosis, ischemia or gangrene. If this occurs consult a vascular surgeon immediately.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Inadvertent Perivascular Injection\n\n\n\n  Inadvertent perivascular injection of Asclera can cause pain. If pain is severe, a local anesthetic (without adrenaline) may be injected.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Injection site reactions occur in 84% of patients and typically consist of one or more of the following: erythema, pain, tenderness, pruritus and local swelling (  5.3  ) \n *  Flu-like symptoms, which typically occur within 2 days after an injection, occur in 30% of patients and include one or more of the following: influenza-like illness, pyrexia, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, malaise or fatigue (  5.4  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Risk of Hepatotoxicity\n\n\n\n  KYNAMRO can cause elevations in transaminases and hepatic steatosis, as described below. To what extent KYNAMRO-associated hepatic steatosis promotes the elevations in transaminases is unknown. There is concern that KYNAMRO could induce steatohepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis over several years. The clinical studies supporting the safety and efficacy of KYNAMRO in HoFH would have been unlikely to detect this adverse outcome given their size and duration [see  Clinical Studies (  14  )    ].\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n   Elevation of Transaminases    \n\n\n\n KYNAMRO can cause increases in serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]).  In the clinical trial, 4 (12%) of the 34 subjects with HoFH treated with KYNAMRO compared to 0% of the 17 subjects treated with placebo had an elevation in ALT >= 3x ULN, and 3 (9%) of those treated with KYNAMRO compared to 0% treated with placebo had at least one elevation in ALT >= 5x ULN.\n\n\n\n Measure a full liver panel to include ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase before initiation of treatment with KYNAMRO [see  Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )    ]. KYNAMRO is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, or active liver disease, including unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases. If the baseline liver-related tests are abnormal, consider initiating KYNAMRO after an appropriate work-up and the baseline abnormalities are explained or resolved. During the first year, conduct liver-related tests monthly (ALT and AST, at a minimum). After the first year, conduct these tests at least every 3 months. Discontinue KYNAMRO for persistent or clinically significant elevations [see  Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )    ].\n\n\n\n If transaminase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, lethargy, flu-like symptoms), increases in bilirubin >= 2x ULN, or active liver disease, discontinue treatment with KYNAMRO and identify the probable cause.\n\n\n\n   Hepatic Steatosis    \n\n\n\n KYNAMRO increases hepatic fat (steatosis) with or without concomitant increases in transaminases [see  Adverse Reactions    (  6.1  )]. Hepatic steatosis is a risk factor for advanced liver disease, including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. The long-term consequences of hepatic steatosis associated with KYNAMRO therapy are unknown. During the clinical trials in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and hyperlipidemia, the median absolute increase in hepatic fat was 10% after 26 weeks of treatment, from 0% at baseline, measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). \n\n\n\n Alcohol may increase levels of hepatic fat and induce or exacerbate liver injury. It is recommended that patients taking KYNAMRO should consume no more than one alcoholic drink per day.\n\n\n\n Caution should be exercised when KYNAMRO is used with other medications known to have potential for hepatotoxicity, for example isotretinoin, amiodarone, acetaminophen (>4 g/day for >= 3 days/week), methotrexate, tetracyclines, and tamoxifen. The effect of concomitant administration of KYNAMRO with other hepatotoxic medications is unknown. More frequent monitoring of liver-related tests may be warranted.\n\n\n\n Mipomersen has not been studied concomitantly with other LDL-lowering agents that can also increase hepatic fat. Therefore, the combined use of such agents is not recommended.\n\n\n\n    5.2 KYNAMRO REMS\n\n\n\n  Because of the risk of hepatotoxicity, KYNAMRO is available only through a limited program under the REMS. Under the KYNAMRO REMS, only certified healthcare providers and pharmacies may prescribe and distribute KYNAMRO. Further information is available at  www.KynamroREMS.com    or by telephone at 1-877-KYNAMRO (1-877-596-2676).\n\n\n\n    5.3 Injection Site Reactions\n\n\n\n  Injection site reactions have been reported in 84% of patients receiving KYNAMRO therapy.  These local reactions typically consist of one or more of the following: erythema, pain, tenderness, pruritus and local swelling. Injection site reactions do not occur with all injections but resulted in discontinuation of therapy in 5% of patients in pooled Phase 3 trials.  [see  Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )    ]  To minimize the potential for injection site reactions, proper technique for subcutaneous administration should be followed.  [see  Patient Counseling Information (  17  )    ]\n\n\n\n    5.4 Flu-Like Symptoms\n\n\n\n  Flu-like symptoms have been reported in 30% of patients receiving KYNAMRO therapy and include one or more of the following: influenza-like illness, pyrexia, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, malaise or fatigue. Flu-like symptoms, which typically occur within 2 days after an injection, do not occur with all injections but resulted in discontinuation of therapy in 3% of patients in pooled Phase 3 trials.

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Risk of bleeding: XARELTO can cause serious and fatal bleeding. Promptly evaluate signs and symptoms of blood loss. (  5.2  ) \n *    Pregnancy-related hemorrhage: Use XARELTO with caution in pregnant women due to the potential for obstetric hemorrhage and/or emergent delivery. Promptly evaluate signs and symptoms of blood loss. (  5.7  ) \n *    Prosthetic heart valves: XARELTO use not recommended (  5.8  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation\n\n\n\n  Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including XARELTO, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from XARELTO to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If XARELTO is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2  ,  2.6  ) and  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Risk of Bleeding\n\n\n\n  XARELTO increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious or fatal bleeding. In deciding whether to prescribe XARELTO to patients at increased risk of bleeding, the risk of thrombotic events should be weighed against the risk of bleeding.\n\n\n\n Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss and consider the need for blood replacement. Discontinue XARELTO in patients with active pathological hemorrhage. The terminal elimination half-life of rivaroxaban is 5 to 9 hours in healthy subjects aged 20 to 45 years.\n\n\n\n Concomitant use of other drugs that impair hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding. These include aspirin, P2Y12platelet inhibitors, other antithrombotic agents, fibrinolytic therapy, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ].  \n\n\n\n Concomitant use of drugs that are combined P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole and ritonavir) increases rivaroxaban exposure and may increase bleeding risk [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect:  \n\n\n\n A specific antidote for rivaroxaban is not available. Because of high plasma protein binding, rivaroxaban is not expected to be dialyzable [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. Partial reversal of prothrombin time prolongation has been seen after administration of prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) in healthy volunteers. The use of other procoagulant reversal agents like activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has not been evaluated.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture\n\n\n\n  When neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural anesthesia) or spinal puncture is employed, patients treated with anticoagulant agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis [see  Boxed Warning  ]  .\n\n\n\n  To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban [see       Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)   ]     . Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.  \n\n\n\n An epidural catheter should not be removed earlier than 18 hours after the last administration of XARELTO. The next XARELTO dose is not to be administered earlier than 6 hours after the removal of the catheter. If traumatic puncture occurs, the administration of XARELTO is to be delayed for 24 hours.\n\n\n\n  Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, monitor frequently to detect any signs or symptoms of neurological impairment, such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness, tingling, or weakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to immediately report if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment\n\n\n\n  Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation\n\n\n\n Avoid the use of XARELTO in patients with CrCl <15 mL/min since drug exposure is increased. Periodically assess renal function as clinically indicated (i.e., more frequently in situations in which renal function may decline) and adjust therapy accordingly .  Discontinue XARELTO in patients who develop acute renal failure while on XARELTO [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  ].  \n\n\n\n   Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), Pulmonary Embolism (PE), and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and of PE\n\n\n\n Avoid the use of XARELTO in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min due to an expected increase in rivaroxaban exposure and pharmacodynamic effects in this patient population [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  ]  .\n\n\n\n   Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery\n\n\n\n Avoid the use of XARELTO in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min due to an expected increase in rivaroxaban exposure and pharmacodynamic effects in this patient population. Observe closely and promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss in patients with CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min. Patients who develop acute renal failure while on XARELTO should discontinue the treatment [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.5 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment\n\n\n\n  No clinical data are available for patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n\n\n\n Avoid use of XARELTO in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment or with any hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy since drug exposure and bleeding risk may be increased [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.8)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.6 Use with P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers\n\n\n\n  Avoid concomitant use of XARELTO with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and conivaptan) [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Avoid concomitant use of XARELTO with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John's wort) [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.7 Risk of Pregnancy-Related Hemorrhage\n\n\n\n  In pregnant women, XARELTO should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. XARELTO dosing in pregnancy has not been studied. The anticoagulant effect of XARELTO cannot be monitored with standard laboratory testing nor readily reversed. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms suggesting blood loss (e.g., a drop in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit, hypotension, or fetal distress).\n\n\n\n    5.8 Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves\n\n\n\n  The safety and efficacy of XARELTO have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves. Therefore, use of XARELTO is not recommended in these patients.\n\n\n\n    5.9 Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients Who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy\n\n\n\n  Initiation of XARELTO is not recommended acutely as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary embolism who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy.\n",

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Prolonged QT Interval, Torsades de pointes, and sudden death: Monitor electrocardiograms and levels of serum potassium, calcium, magnesium and TSH. Reduce CAPRELSA dose as appropriate. (  2.1  ,  5.1  ) \n *    Severe skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, some resulting in death: Consider discontinuation of CAPRELSA for severe skin reactions. (  2.1  ,  5.2  ) \n *    Interstitial lung disease (ILD), including fatalities: investigate unexplained non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms. Discontinue CAPRELSA for confirmed ILD. (  2.1  ,  5.3  ) \n *    Ischemic cerebrovascular events, hemorrhage, heart failure, diarrhea, hypertension, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome: Discontinue or interrupt CAPRELSA. (  2.1  ,  5.4  ,  5.5  ,  5.6  ,  5.7  ,  5.8  ,  5.9  ,  5.10  ) \n *    Embryofetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy during and for four months following treatment with CAPRELSA. (  5.14  ,  8.1  ) \n *    REMS: CAPRELSA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the CAPRELSA REMS Program. (  5.15  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes\n\n\n\n  CAPRELSA can prolong the QT interval in a concentration-dependent manner [see   Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)    ]. Torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia and sudden deaths have occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA.\n\n\n\n Do not start CAPRELSA treatment in patients whose QTcF interval is greater than 450 ms. Do not administer CAPRELSA to patients who have a history of Torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias or uncompensated heart failure. CAPRELSA has not been studied in patients with ventricular arrhythmias or recent myocardial infarction. Vandetanib exposure is increased in patients with impaired renal function. Reduce the starting dose to 200 mg in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and monitor QT interval frequently.\n\n\n\n Obtain an ECG and serum potassium, calcium, magnesium and TSH at baseline, 2-4 weeks and 8-12 weeks after starting treatment with CAPRELSA, and every 3 months thereafter. Monitor electrolytes and ECGs more frequently in patients who experience diarrhea. Following any dose reduction for QT prolongation or any dose interruption greater than 2 weeks, conduct QT assessments as described above. Maintain serum potassium levels of 4 mEq/L or higher (within normal range) and maintain serum magnesium and calcium levels within normal ranges to reduce the risk of QT prolongation.\n\n\n\n Avoid using CAPRELSA with drugs known to prolong the QT interval [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.11)    and   Drug Interactions (7.4)    ]. If such drugs are given to patients already receiving CAPRELSA and no alternative therapy exists, perform ECG monitoring of the QT interval more frequently.\n\n\n\n Stop CAPRELSA in patients who develop a QTcF greater than 500 ms until the QTcF returns to less than 450 ms. Dosing of CAPRELSA can then be resumed at a reduced dose [see   Dosage and Administration (2.1)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.2 Skin Reactions and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Severe skin reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome), some leading to death, have occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Consider permanent discontinuation of CAPRELSA for severe skin reactions [see   Dosage and Administration (2.1)    ].\n\n\n\n Photosensitivity reactions can occur during CAPRELSA treatment and up to 4 months after treatment discontinuation.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease\n\n\n\n  Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) or pneumonitis, including fatalities, has occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Consider a diagnosis of ILD in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms.\n\n\n\n Interrupt CAPRELSA for acute or worsening pulmonary symptoms. Discontinue CAPRELSA if ILD is confirmed.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Ischemic Cerebrovascular Events\n\n\n\n  Ischemic cerebrovascular events, including fatalities, occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. In the randomized medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) study, ischemic cerebrovascular events occurred more frequently with CAPRELSA compared to placebo (1.3% compared to 0%). The safety of resumption of CAPRELSA therapy after resolution of an ischemic cerebrovascular event has not been studied. Discontinue CAPRELSA in patients who experience a severe ischemic cerebrovascular event.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Hemorrhage\n\n\n\n  Serious hemorrhagic events, including fatalities, occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Do not administer CAPRELSA to patients with a recent history of hemoptysis of >=1/2 teaspoon of red blood. Discontinue CAPRELSA in patients with severe hemorrhage.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Heart Failure\n\n\n\n  Heart failure, including fatalities, occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of heart failure. Consider discontinuation of CAPRELSA in patients with heart failure. Heart failure may not be reversible upon stopping CAPRELSA.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Diarrhea\n\n\n\n  Diarrhea of Grade 3 or greater severity occurred in 11% of patients receiving CAPRELSA in the randomized MTC study. If diarrhea occurs, carefully monitor serum electrolytes and ECGs to reduce the risk and enable early detection of QT prolongation resulting from dehydration [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)    ]. Interrupt CAPRELSA for severe diarrhea. Upon improvement, resume CAPRELSA at a reduced dose [see   Dosage and Administration (2.1)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.8 Hypothyroidism\n\n\n\n  In the randomized MTC study in which 90% of the patients enrolled had prior thyroidectomy, increased dosing of thyroid replacement therapy was required in 49% of CAPRELSA-treated patients compared to 17% of placebo-treated patients. Obtain Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at baseline, at 2 - 4 weeks and 8 - 12 weeks after starting treatment with CAPRELSA, and every 3 months thereafter. If signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism occur, examine thyroid hormone levels and adjust thyroid replacement therapy accordingly..\n\n\n\n    5.9 Hypertension\n\n\n\n  Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Monitor all patients for hypertension. Dose reduction or interruption for hypertension may be necessary. If hypertension cannot be controlled, do not resume CAPRELSA [see   Dosage and Administration, (2.1)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.10 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by an MRI of the brain, has occurred in patients treated with CAPRELSA. Consider this syndrome in any patient presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. In clinical studies, three of four patients who developed RPLS while taking CAPRELSA also had hypertension. Discontinue CAPRELSA treatment in patients with RPLS.\n\n\n\n    5.11 Drug Interactions\n\n\n\n  Avoid administration of CAPRELSA with anti-arrhythmic drugs (including but not limited to amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, sotalol, dofetilide) and other drugs that may prolong the QT interval (including but not limited to chloroquine, clarithromycin, dolasetron, granisetron, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, and pimozide) [see   Drug Interactions (7.4)    and   Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.12 Renal Impairment\n\n\n\n  Vandetanib exposure is increased in patients with impaired renal function. Reduce the starting dose to 200 mg in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and monitor the QT interval closely. There is no information available for patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [see   Boxed Warning    ,   Dosage and Administration (2.1)    ,   Use in Specific Populations (8.6)    and   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.13 Hepatic Impairment\n\n\n\n  CAPRELSA is not recommended for use in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, as safety and efficacy have not been established [see   Dosage and Administration (2.1)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.14 Embryofetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Based on its mechanism of action, CAPRELSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In nonclinical studies in rats, vandetanib was embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic at exposures equivalent to or lower than those expected at the recommended human dose of 300 mg/day and had adverse effects on female fertility, embryofetal development, and postnatal development of pups.\n\n\n\n If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Women of childbearing potential should avoid pregnancy. Advise women of childbearing potential that they must use effective contraception during CAPRELSA treatment and for at least four months following the last dose of CAPRELSA [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.8  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.15 CAPRELSA REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) Program\n\n\n\n  Because of the risk of QT prolongation, Torsades de pointes, and sudden death, CAPRELSA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the CAPRELSA REMS Program. Only prescribers and pharmacies certified with the program are able to prescribe and dispense CAPRELSA.\n\n\n\n To learn about the specific REMS requirements and to enroll in the CAPRELSA REMS Program, call 1-800-236-9933 or visit www.caprelsarems.com.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Pulmonary Toxicity: Permanently discontinue KADCYLA in patients diagnosed with interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis. (  2.2  ,  5.4  ) \n *  Infusion-Related Reactions, Hypersensitivity Reactions: Monitor for signs and symptoms during and after infusion. If significant infusion-related reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occur, slow or interrupt the infusion and administer appropriate medical therapies. Permanently discontinue KADCYLA for life threatening infusion-related reaction. (  2.1  ,  2.2  ,  5.5  ) \n *  Hemorrhage: Fatal cases of hemorrhage occurred in clinical trials among patients with no known identified risk factors, as well as among patients with thrombocytopenia and those receiving anti-coagulation and antiplatelet therapy. Use caution with these agents and consider additional monitoring when concomitant use is medically necessary . (  5.6  ) \n *  Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet counts prior to each KADCYLA dose. Institute dose modifications as appropriate. (  2.2  ,  5.7  ) \n *  Neurotoxicity: Monitor for signs or symptoms. Withhold dosing temporarily for patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy. (  2.2  ,  5.8  ,  13.2  ) \n *  HER2 Testing: Perform using FDA-approved tests by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. (  5.9  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hepatotoxicity\n\n\n\n  Hepatotoxicity, predominantly in the form of asymptomatic, transient increases in the concentrations of serum transaminases, has been observed in clinical trials with KADCYLA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Serious hepatobiliary disorders, including at least two fatal cases of severe drug-induced liver injury and associated hepatic encephalopathy, have been reported in clinical trials with KADCYLA. Some of the observed cases may have been confounded by comorbidities and/or concomitant medications with known hepatotoxic potential.\n\n\n\n Monitor serum transaminases and bilirubin prior to initiation of KADCYLA treatment and prior to each KADCYLA dose. Patients with known active hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus were excluded from Study 1 [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . Reduce the dose or discontinue KADCYLA as appropriate in cases of increased serum transaminases and/or total bilirubin [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . Permanently discontinue KADCYLA treatment in patients with serum transaminases > 3 * ULN and concomitant total bilirubin > 2 * ULN. KADCYLA has not been studied in patients with serum transaminases > 2.5 * ULN or bilirubin > 1.5 * ULN prior to the initiation of treatment.\n\n\n\n  In clinical trials of KADCYLA, cases of nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver have been identified from liver biopsies (3 cases out of 884 treated patients, one of which was fatal). Two of these three cases of NRH were observed in the randomized trial (Study 1) [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . NRH is a rare liver condition characterized by widespread benign transformation of hepatic parenchyma into small regenerative nodules; NRH may lead to non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. The diagnosis of NRH can be confirmed only by histopathology. NRH should be considered in all patients with clinical symptoms of portal hypertension and/or cirrhosis-like pattern seen on the computed tomography (CT) scan of the liver but with normal transaminases and no other manifestations of cirrhosis. Upon diagnosis of NRH, KADCYLA treatment must be permanently discontinued.  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction\n\n\n\n  Patients treated with KADCYLA are at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. A decrease of LVEF to < 40% has been observed in patients treated with KADCYLA. In the randomized trial (Study 1), left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 1.8% of patients in the KADCYLA-treated group and 3.3% of patients in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Assess LVEF prior to initiation of KADCYLA and at regular intervals (e.g. every three months) during treatment to ensure the LVEF is within the institution's normal limits. Treatment with KADCYLA has not been studied in patients with LVEF < 50% prior to initiation of treatment. If, at routine monitoring, LVEF is < 40%, or is 40% to 45% with a 10% or greater absolute decrease below the pretreatment value, withhold KADCYLA and repeat LVEF assessment within approximately 3 weeks. Permanently discontinue KADCYLA if the LVEF has not improved or has declined further [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . Patients with a history of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), serious cardiac arrhythmia, or history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months were excluded from Study 1 [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  KADCYLA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of KADCYLA in pregnant women and no reproductive and developmental toxicology studies have been conducted with ado-trastuzumab emtansine. Nevertheless, treatment with trastuzumab, the antibody component of KADCYLA, during pregnancy in the postmarketing setting has resulted in oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities and neonatal death. DM1, the cytotoxic component of KADCYLA, can be expected to cause embryo-fetal toxicity based on its mechanism of action.\n\n\n\n  If KADCYLA is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving KADCYLA or within 7 months following the last dose of KADCYLA, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n  Verify pregnancy status prior to the initiation of KADCYLA. Advise patients of the risks of embryo-fetal death and birth defects and the need for contraception during and after treatment. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately if they suspect they may be pregnant. If KADCYLA is administered during pregnancy or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving KADCYLA or within 7 months following the last dose of KADCYLA, immediately report exposure to the Genentech Adverse Event Line at 1-888-835-2555. Encourage women who may be exposed during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception, to enroll in the MotHER Pregnancy Registry by contacting 1-800-690-6720 [see  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, some leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome or fatal outcome have been reported in clinical trials with KADCYLA. Pneumonitis at an incidence of 0.8% (7 out of 884 treated patients) has been reported, with one case of grade 3 pneumonitis. Signs and symptoms include dyspnea, cough, fatigue, and pulmonary infiltrates. These events may or may not occur as sequelae of infusion reactions. In the randomized trial (Study 1), the overall frequency of pneumonitis was 1.2% [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Permanently discontinue treatment with KADCYLA in patients diagnosed with ILD or pneumonitis.\n\n\n\n Patients with dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and co-morbidities may be at increased risk of pulmonary toxicity.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Infusion-Related Reactions, Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Treatment with KADCYLA has not been studied in patients who had trastuzumab permanently discontinued due to infusion-related reactions (IRR) and/or hypersensitivity; treatment with KADCYLA is not recommended for these patients.\n\n\n\n Infusion-related reactions, characterized by one or more of the following symptoms - flushing, chills, pyrexia, dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, and tachycardia have been reported in clinical trials of KADCYLA. In the randomized trial (Study 1), the overall frequency of IRRs in patients treated with KADCYLA was 1.4% [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . In most patients, these reactions resolved over the course of several hours to a day after the infusion was terminated. KADCYLA treatment should be interrupted in patients with severe IRR. KADCYLA treatment should be permanently discontinued in the event of a life-threatening IRR [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . Patients should be observed closely for IRR reactions, especially during the first infusion.\n\n\n\n One case of a serious, allergic/anaphylactic-like reaction has been observed in clinical trials of single-agent KADCYLA. Medications to treat such reactions, as well as emergency equipment, should be available for immediate use.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Hemorrhage\n\n\n\n   Cases of hemorrhagic events, including central nervous system, respiratory, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, have been reported in clinical trials with Kadcyla. Some of these bleeding events resulted in fatal outcomes. In the randomized trial (Study 1), the overall frequency of hemorrhage was 32.2% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 16.4% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group. The incidence of >= Grade 3 hemorrhage was 1.8% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 0.8% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Although, in some of the observed cases the patients were also receiving anti-coagulation therapy, antiplatelet therapy, or had thrombocytopenia, in others there were no known additional risk factors. Use caution with these agents and consider additional monitoring when concomitant use is medically necessary.  \n\n\n\n    5.7 Thrombocytopenia\n\n\n\n  Thrombocytopenia, or decreased platelet count, was reported in clinical trials of KADCYLA (103 of 884 treated patients with >= Grade 3; 283 of 884 treated patients with any Grade). The majority of these patients had Grade 1 or 2 events (< LLN to >= 50,000/mm  3  ) with the nadir occurring by day 8 and generally improving to Grade 0 or 1 (>= 75,000 /mm  3  ) by the next scheduled dose. In clinical trials of KADCYLA, the incidence and severity of thrombocytopenia were higher in Asian patients.\n\n\n\n In the randomized trial (Study 1), the overall frequency of thrombocytopenia was 31.2% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 3.3% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . The incidence of >= Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was 14.5% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 0.4% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group. In Asian patients, the incidence of >= Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was 45.1% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 1.3% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group.\n\n\n\n Monitor platelet counts prior to initiation of KADCYLA and prior to each KADCYLA dose [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . KADCYLA has not been studied in patients with platelet counts <100,000/mm  3  prior to initiation of treatment. In the event of decreased platelet count to Grade 3 or greater (< 50,000/mm  3  ) do not administer KADCYLA until platelet counts recover to Grade 1 (>= 75,000/mm  3  ) [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  . Patients with thrombocytopenia (< 100,000/mm  3  ) and patients on anti-coagulant treatment should be closely monitored during treatment with KADCYLA.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Neurotoxicity\n\n\n\n  Peripheral neuropathy, mainly as Grade 1 and predominantly sensory, was reported in clinical trials of KADCYLA (14 of 884 treated patients with >= Grade 3; 196 of 884 treated patients with any Grade). In the randomized trial (Study 1), the overall frequency of peripheral neuropathy was 21.2% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 13.5% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . The incidence of >= Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was 2.2% in the KADCYLA-treated group and 0.2% in the lapatinib plus capecitabine-treated group.\n\n\n\n KADCYLA should be temporarily discontinued in patients experiencing Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy until resolution to <= Grade 2. Patients should be clinically monitored on an ongoing basis for signs or symptoms of neurotoxicity [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.9 HER2 Testing\n\n\n\n  Detection of HER2 protein overexpression or gene amplification is necessary for selection of patients appropriate for KADCYLA therapy because these are the only patients studied for whom benefit has been shown [see  Indications and Usage (1)  ,  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . In the randomized study (Study 1), patients with breast cancer were required to have evidence of HER2 overexpression defined as 3+ IHC by Dako HerceptestTM or evidence of overexpression defined as FISH amplification ratio >= 2.0 by Dako HER2  FISH PharmDxTM test kit. Only limited data were available for patients whose breast cancer was positive by FISH and 0 or 1+ by IHC.\n\n\n\n Assessment of HER2 status should be performed by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency in the specific technology being utilized. Improper assay performance, including use of sub- optimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents, deviation from specific assay instructions, and failure to include appropriate controls for assay validation, can lead to unreliable results.\n\n\n\n    5.10 Extravasation\n\n\n\n  In KADCYLA clinical studies, reactions secondary to extravasation have been observed. These reactions, observed more frequently within 24 hours of infusion, were usually mild and comprised erythema, tenderness, skin irritation, pain, or swelling at the infusion site. Specific treatment for KADCYLA extravasation is unknown. The infusion site should be closely monitored for possible subcutaneous infiltration during drug administration.\n",

To what extent JUXTAPID-associated hepatic steatosis promotes the elevations in transaminases is unknown. Although cases of hepatic dysfunction (elevated transaminases with increase in bilirubin or INR) or hepatic failure have not been reported, there is concern that JUXTAPID could induce steatohepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis over several years. The clinical studies supporting the safety and efficacy of JUXTAPID in HoFH would have been unlikely to detect this adverse outcome given their size and duration [see  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  .\n\n\n\n  Elevation of Transaminases  \n\n\n\n Elevations in transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) are associated with JUXTAPID. In the clinical trial, 10 (34%) of the 29 patients with HoFH had at least one elevation in ALT or AST >=3x ULN, and 4 (14%) of the patients had at least one elevation in ALT or AST >=5x ULN. There were no concomitant or subsequent clinically meaningful elevations in bilirubin, INR, or alkaline phosphatase [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n During the 78-week HoFH clinical trial, no patients discontinued prematurely because of elevated transaminases. Among the 19 patients who subsequently enrolled in the HoFH extension study, one discontinued because of increased transaminases that persisted despite several dose reductions, and one temporarily discontinued because of markedly elevated transaminases (ALT 24x ULN, AST 13x ULN) that had several possible causes, including a drug-drug interaction between JUXTAPID and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Measure ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin before initiation of treatment with JUXTAPID [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  . JUXTAPID is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, or active liver disease, including unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases. If the baseline liver-related tests are abnormal, one may consider initiating JUXTAPID after an appropriate work-up and the baseline abnormalities are explained or resolved. During the first year, measure liver-related tests (ALT and AST, at a minimum) prior to each increase in dose or monthly, whichever occurs first. After the first year, do these tests at least every 3 months and before any increase in dose. Modify the dose of JUXTAPID if elevations of transaminases are observed and discontinue JUXTAPID for persistent or clinically significant elevations [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  ]  .\n\n\n\n If transaminase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury (such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, lethargy, flu-like symptoms), increases in bilirubin >=2x ULN, or active liver disease, discontinue treatment with JUXTAPID and identify the probable cause.\n\n\n\n  Hepatic Steatosis  \n\n\n\n JUXTAPID increases hepatic fat, with or without concomitant increases in transaminases. Hepatic steatosis is a risk factor for progressive liver disease, including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. The long-term consequences of hepatic steatosis associated with JUXTAPID treatment are unknown. During the HoFH clinical trial, the median absolute increase in hepatic fat was 6% after both 26 weeks and 78 weeks of treatment, from 1% at baseline, measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Clinical data suggest that hepatic fat accumulation is reversible after stopping treatment with JUXTAPID, but whether histological sequelae remain is unknown, especially after long-term use; protocol liver biopsies were not performed in the HoFH clinical trial.\n\n\n\n Alcohol may increase levels of hepatic fat and induce or exacerbate liver injury. It is recommended that patients taking JUXTAPID should not consume more than one alcoholic drink per day.\n\n\n\n Caution should be exercised when JUXTAPID is used with other medications known to have potential for hepatotoxicity, such as isotretinoin, amiodarone, acetaminophen (>4 g/day for >=3 days/week), methotrexate, tetracyclines, and tamoxifen. The effect of concomitant administration of JUXTAPID with other hepatotoxic medications is unknown. More frequent monitoring of liver-related tests may be warranted.\n\n\n\n JUXTAPID has not been studied concomitantly with other LDL-lowering agents that can also increase hepatic fat. Therefore, the combined use of such agents is not recommended.\n\n\n\n    5.2 JUXTAPID REMS Program\n\n\n\n  Because of the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with JUXTAPID therapy, JUXTAPID is available through a restricted program under the REMS. Under the JUXTAPID REMS, only certified healthcare providers and pharmacies may prescribe and distribute JUXTAPID. Further information is available at www.JUXTAPIDREMSProgram.com  or by telephone at 1-85-JUXTAPID (1-855-898-2743).\n\n\n\n    5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  JUXTAPID may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on findings of teratogenicity in rats and ferrets [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  . Females of reproductive potential should have a negative pregnancy test before starting JUXTAPID and should use effective contraception during therapy with JUXTAPID [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  . If oral contraceptives are used, the maximum recommended dosage of JUXTAPID is 30 mg daily [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4 Reduced Absorption of Fat-Soluble Vitamins and Serum Fatty Acids\n\n\n\n  Given its mechanism of action in the small intestine, JUXTAPID may reduce the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. In the HoFH clinical trial, patients were provided daily dietary supplements of vitamin E, linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In this trial, the median levels of serum vitamin E, ALA, linoleic acid, EPA, DHA, and arachidonic acid decreased from baseline to Week 26 but remained above the lower limit of the reference range. Adverse clinical consequences of these reductions were not observed with JUXTAPID treatment of up to 78 weeks. Patients treated with JUXTAPID should take daily supplements that contain 400 international units vitamin E and at least 200 mg linoleic acid, 210 mg ALA, 110 mg EPA, and 80 mg DHA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  . Patients with chronic bowel or pancreatic diseases that predispose to malabsorption may be at increased risk for deficiencies in these nutrients with use of JUXTAPID.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions\n\n\n\n  Gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported by 27 (93%) of 29 patients in the HoFH clinical trial. Diarrhea occurred in 79% of patients, nausea in 65%, dyspepsia in 38%, and vomiting in 34%. Other reactions reported by at least 20% of patients include abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, constipation, and flatulence [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Gastrointestinal adverse reactions of severe intensity were reported by 6 (21%) of 29 patients in the HoFH clinical trial, with the most common being diarrhea (4 patients, 14%); vomiting (3 patients, 10%); and abdominal pain, distension, and/or discomfort (2 patients, 7%). Gastrointestinal reactions contributed to the reasons for early discontinuation from the trial for 4 (14%) patients.\n\n\n\n Absorption of concomitant oral medications may be affected in patients who develop diarrhea or vomiting.\n\n\n\n To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events, patients should adhere to a low-fat diet supplying <20% of energy from fat and the dosage of JUXTAPID should be increased gradually [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  and  (2.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.6 Concomitant Use of CYP3A4 Inhibitors\n\n\n\n  CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the exposure of lomitapide, with strong inhibitors increasing exposure approximately 27-fold. Concomitant use of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with JUXTAPID is contraindicated [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  . In the JUXTAPID clinical trials, one patient with HoFH developed markedly elevated transaminases (ALT 24x ULN, AST 13x ULN) within days of initiating the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin. If treatment with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is unavoidable, JUXTAPID should be stopped during the course of treatment.\n\n\n\n Grapefruit juice must be omitted from the diet while being treated with JUXTAPID.\n\n\n\n Weak CYP3A4 inhibitors increase the exposure of lomitapide approximately 2-fold; therefore, JUXTAPID dosage should not exceed 30 mg daily when it is used concomitantly with these inhibitors, including atorvastatin and oral contraceptives [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  and  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.7 Risk of Myopathy with Concomitant Use of Simvastatin or Lovastatin\n\n\n\n  The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, with simvastatin and lovastatin monotherapy is dose related. Lomitapide approximately doubles the exposure to simvastatin; therefore, it is recommended to reduce the dose of simvastatin by 50% when initiating JUXTAPID [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . While taking JUXTAPID, limit simvastatin dosage to 20 mg daily (or 40 mg daily for patients who have previously tolerated simvastatin 80 mg daily for at least one year without evidence of muscle toxicity). Refer to the simvastatin prescribing information for additional dosing recommendations.\n\n\n\n Interaction between lovastatin and lomitapide has not been studied. However, the metabolizing enzymes and transporters responsible for the disposition of lovastatin and simvastatin are similar, suggesting that JUXTAPID may increase the exposure of lovastatin; therefore, reducing the dose of lovastatin should be considered when initiating JUXTAPID.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Risk of Supratherapeutic or Subtherapeutic Anticoagulation with Warfarin\n\n\n\n  JUXTAPID increases the plasma concentrations of warfarin. Increases in the dose of JUXTAPID may lead to supratherapeutic anticoagulation, and decreases in the dose of JUXTAPID may lead to subtherapeutic anticoagulation. Difficulty controlling INR contributed to early discontinuation from the HoFH clinical trial for one of five patients taking concomitant warfarin. Patients taking warfarin should undergo regular monitoring of the INR, especially after any changes in JUXTAPID dosage. The dose of warfarin should be adjusted as clinically indicated [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.9 Risk of Malabsorption with Rare Hereditary Disorders of Galactose Intolerance\n\n\n\n  Patients with rare, hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should avoid JUXTAPID as this may result in diarrhea and malabsorption.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Suicidality: Monitor for worsening of depressive symptoms and suicide risk (  5.1  ). \n *    Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome has been reported with SSRIs and SNRIs, including Savella, both when taken alone, but especially when co-administered with other serotonergic agents (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone and St. John's Wort). If such symptoms occur, discontinue Savella and initiate supportive treatment. If concomitant use of Savella with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment and dose increases (  5.2  ). \n *    Elevated blood pressure and heart rate: Savella may increase blood pressure and heart rate. In an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring study, a substantially higher proportion of Savella-treated patients experienced clinically significant blood pressure and heart rate elevations as compared with placebo-treated patients. Measure blood pressure and heart rate prior to initiating treatment with Savella and monitor periodically throughout treatment (  5.3  ,  5.4  ). \n *    Seizures: Cases have been reported with Savella therapy. Prescribe Savella with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder (  5.5  ). \n *    Hepatotoxicity: More patients treated with Savella than with placebo experienced mild elevations of ALT and AST. Rarely, fulminant hepatitis has been reported in patients treated with Savella. Avoid concomitant use of Savella in patients with substantial alcohol use or chronic liver disease (  5.6  ). \n *    Discontinuation: Withdrawal symptoms have been reported in patients when discontinuing treatment with Savella. A gradual dose reduction is recommended (  5.7  ). \n *    Abnormal Bleeding: Savella may increase the risk of bleeding events. Caution patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Savella and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation (  5.9  ). \n *    Male patients with a history of obstructive uropathies may experience higher rates of genitourinary adverse events (  5.11  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Suicide Risk\n\n\n\n  Savella is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor (SNRI), similar to some drugs used for the treatment of depression and other psychiatric disorders.\n\n\n\n Patients, both adult and pediatric, with depression or other psychiatric disorders may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking these medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants, including drugs that inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin, may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.\n\n\n\n In the placebo-controlled clinical trials of adults with fibromyalgia, among the patients who had a history of depression at treatment initiation, the incidence of suicidal ideation was 0.5% in patients treated with placebo, 0% in patients treated with Savella 100 mg/day, and 1.3% in patients treated with Savella 200 mg/day. No suicides occurred in the short-term or longer-term (up to 1 year) fibromyalgia trials.\n\n\n\n Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of drugs used to treat depression (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with these drugs compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in suicidality risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults age 65 and older.\n\n\n\n The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 drugs used to treat depression in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients.\n\n\n\n There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk of differences (drug versus placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in   Table 1    .\n\n\n\n Table 1: Risk Differences (Drug - Placebo) in the number of Cases of Suicidality, per 1000 patients treated \n  Age Range         Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated    \n  < 18              14 additional cases                                                                   \n  18-24             5 additional cases                                                                    \n                    Decreases Compared to Placebo                                                         \n  25-64             1 fewer case                                                                          \n  >= 65             6 fewer cases                                                                         \n        No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\n \n\n It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months.\n\n\n\n However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.\n\n\n\n  All patients being treated with drugs inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases  .\n\n\n\n The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with drugs inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.\n\n\n\n Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients who may experience worsening depressive symptoms, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe or abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.\n\n\n\n If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment due to worsening depressive symptoms or emergent suicidality, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can produce withdrawal symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ,  2.4  ), and Warnings and Precautions (  5.7  )]  .\n\n\n\n  Families and caregivers of patients being treated with drugs inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for Savella should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Serotonin Syndrome\n\n\n\n  The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including Savella, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).\n\n\n\n Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.\n\n\n\n The concomitant use of Savella with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Savella should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Savella. Savella should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (  4.1  ), Dosage and Administration (  2.5  ,  2.6  )].  \n\n\n\n If concomitant use of Savella with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.\n\n\n\n Treatment with Savella and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur, and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Elevated Blood Pressure\n\n\n\n  A double-blind, placebo-controlled ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) study was conducted to evaluate the effects of milnacipran (up to 200 mg/day) on blood pressure in 321 fibromyalgia patients. Among fibromyalgia patients who were normotensive at baseline, an analysis of the blood pressure findings demonstrated a substantially higher proportion of Savella-treated patients had a hypertensive blood pressure measurement at the Week 4, 50 mg BID steady state visit (17.7% [n=21/119]) and the Week 7, 100 mg BID steady state visit (14.3% [n=15/105]) as compared to placebo-treated patients (3.7% [n=2/54] and 0% [0/49] at the Week 4 and Week 7 visits, respectively). Hypertension was defined as mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) >=140 mmHg and change from baseline in mean SBP >=10 mmHg or mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >=90 mmHg and change from baseline in mean DBP >=5 mmHg for the 12-hour period post AM study drug measurement at that visit. Furthermore, 1.9% (4/210) of Savella-treated and 0.9% (1/111) of placebo patients discontinued treatment for increases in blood pressure.\n\n\n\n The increased risk of blood pressure measurements in the hypertensive range in Savella-treated patients is supported by substantial increases in mean SBP and DBP measurements observed in the ABPM study.   Table 2    shows that, following treatment with Savella 50 mg BID for three weeks in patients who were normotensive at baseline, the mean increase from baseline was 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). After further treatment with Savella 100 mg BID for two weeks, the mean increase from baseline in SBP and DBP was 6 mmHg. Similar elevations occurred in Savella-treated patients who were hypertensive at baseline.\n\n\n\n Table 2: Mean (Standard Error) Change from Baseline in Mean 24-hour Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg) of Milnacipran or Placebo following 4 Weeks of Treatment (50mg BID) and a Subsequent 2 Weeks of Treatment (100mg BID) \n           *Blood pressure measurements made after 3 weeks of milnacipran 50mg BID   \n           ^Blood pressure measurements made after 2 weeks of milnacipran 100mg BID   \n  \n                            Normotensive    Hypertensive    \n                            n            Systolic       Diastolic      n             Systolic       Diastolic      \n  Placebo                   39           0(2)           -1(1)          50            0(2)           0(2)           \n  50 mg BID*                92           5(1)           5(1)           84            5(2)           4(1)           \n                                                                                                                   \n  Placebo                   37           0(2)           -1(1)          47            -1(2)          0(1)           \n  100 mg BID^               82           6(1)           6(1)           80            5(2)           4(1)           \n             Similar patterns of treatment-emergent blood pressure elevations were observed in Phase 3 and clinical pharmacology studies as manifested by an increased risk of new onset hypertension or substantial increases in end of study blood pressure measurements in patients with hypertension at baseline (   Table 3    ).\n \n\n Table 3: Blood pressure changes in Phase 3 randomized controlled trials \n                                            Milnacipran50 mg BID    Milnacipran100 mg BID    Placebo               \n  FM patients normotensive at baseline who became hypertensive (defined as SBP >= 140 mmHg or DBP >= 90 mmHg on three consecutive post-baseline visits)    20%                   17%                   7%                    \n  FM patients with sustained increases in SBP (increase of >= 15 mmHg on three consecutive post-baseline visits)    9%                    6%                    2%                    \n  FM patients with sustained increases in DBP (increase of >= 10 mmHg on three consecutive post-baseline visits)    13%                   10 %                  4%                    \n                                            \n  FM patients hypertensive at baseline who had increases in SBP >= 15 mmHg at end of study    10%                   7%                    4%                    \n  FM patients hypertensive at baseline who had increases in DBP >= 10 mmHg at end of study    8%                    6%                    3%                    \n          Sustained increases in blood pressure may have adverse consequences. Cases of elevated blood pressure requiring immediate treatment have been reported.\n \n\n Concomitant use of Savella with drugs that increase blood pressure and heart rate has not been evaluated and such combinations should be used with caution [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .\n\n\n\n Effects of Savella on blood pressure in patients with significant hypertension or cardiac disease have not been systematically evaluated. Savella should be used with caution in these patients.\n\n\n\n Measure blood pressure prior to initiating treatment and periodically monitor blood pressure throughout Savella treatment. Treat pre-existing hypertension and other cardiovascular disease before starting therapy with Savella. For patients who experience a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving Savella, either reduce the dose or discontinue treatment with Savella if clinically warranted.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Elevated Heart Rate\n\n\n\n  A double-blind, placebo-controlled ABPM study was conducted to evaluate the effects of milnacipran (up to 200 mg/day) on blood pressure in 321 fibromyalgia patients [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  )]  . Information on heart rate was also collected. Following treatment with Savella 50mg BID for three weeks in patients who were normotensive at baseline, the mean increase in mean 24-hour heart rate from baseline was 13 beats per minute. After further treatment with Savella 100 mg BID for two weeks, the mean increase from baseline in heart rate was 13 beats per minute.\n\n\n\n Similar trends were observed in the clinical trials where Savella treatment was associated with mean increases in heart rate of approximately 7 to 8 beats per minute [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ]  .\n\n\n\n Increases in heart rate >= 20 beats per minute occurred more frequently in Savella-treated patients when compared to placebo (8% in the Savella 50 mg BID and 100 mg BID treatment arms versus 0.3% in the placebo arm).\n\n\n\n Savella has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a cardiac rhythm disorder.\n\n\n\n Measure heart rate prior to initiating treatment and periodically monitor the heart rate throughout Savella treatment. Treat pre-existing tachyarrhythmias and other cardiac disease before starting therapy with Savella. For patients who experience a sustained increase in heart rate while receiving Savella, either reduce the dose or discontinue treatment with Savella if clinically warranted.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Seizures\n\n\n\n  Savella has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. In clinical trials evaluating Savella in patients with fibromyalgia, seizures/convulsions have not been reported. However, seizures have been reported infrequently in patients treated with Savella for disorders other than fibromyalgia. Savella should be prescribed with care in patients with a history of a seizure disorder.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Hepatotoxicity\n\n\n\n  In the placebo-controlled fibromyalgia trials, increases in the number of patients treated with Savella with mild elevations of ALT or AST (1-3 times the upper limit of normal, ULN) were observed. Increases in ALT were more frequently observed in the patients treated with Savella 100 mg/day (6%) and Savella 200 mg/day (7%), compared to the patients treated with placebo (3%). One patient receiving Savella 100 mg/day (0.2%) had an increase in ALT greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal but did not exceed 10 times the upper limit of normal. Increases in AST were more frequently observed in the patients treated with Savella 100 mg/day (3%) and Savella 200 mg/day (5%) compared to the patients treated with placebo (2%).\n\n\n\n The increases of bilirubin observed in the fibromyalgia clinical trials were not clinically significant.\n\n\n\n No case met the criteria of elevated ALT > 3x ULN and associated with an increase in bilirubin >= 2x ULN.\n\n\n\n There have been cases of increased liver enzymes and reports of severe liver injury, including fulminant hepatitis with milnacipran from foreign postmarketing experience. In the cases of severe liver injury, there were significant underlying clinical conditions and/or the use of multiple concomitant medications. Because of underreporting, it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate of the true incidence of these reactions.\n\n\n\n Savella should be discontinued in patients who develop jaundice or other evidence of liver dysfunction. Treatment with Savella should not be resumed unless another cause can be established.\n\n\n\n Savella should ordinarily not be prescribed to patients with substantial alcohol use or evidence of chronic liver disease.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Discontinuation of Treatment with Savella\n\n\n\n  Withdrawal symptoms have been observed in clinical trials following discontinuation of milnacipran, as with other SNRIs and SSRIs.\n\n\n\n During marketing of milnacipran, and other SNRIs and SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events indicative of withdrawal and physical dependence occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when discontinuation is abrupt. The adverse events include the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. Although these events are generally self-limiting, some have been reported to be severe.\n\n\n\n Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with Savella. Savella should be tapered and not abruptly discontinued after extended use. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (  2.4  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.8 Hyponatremia\n\n\n\n  Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including Savella. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SNRIs, SSRIs, or Savella. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume-depleted may be at greater risk [see Geriatric Use (  8.5  )]  . Discontinuation of Savella should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia.\n\n\n\n Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.\n\n\n\n    5.9 Abnormal Bleeding\n\n\n\n  SSRIs and SNRIs, including Savella, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, and other anti-coagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.\n\n\n\n Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Savella and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation.\n\n\n\n    5.10 Activation of Mania\n\n\n\n  No activation of mania or hypomania was reported in the clinical trials evaluating effects of Savella in patients with fibromyalgia. However those clinical trials excluded patients with current major depressive episode. Activation of mania and hypomania have been reported in patients with mood disorders who were treated with other similar drugs for major depressive disorder. As with these other agents, Savella should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania.\n\n\n\n    5.11 Patients with a History of Dysuria\n\n\n\n  Because of their noradrenergic effect, SNRIs including Savella, can affect urethral resistance and micturition. In the controlled fibromyalgia trials, dysuria occurred more frequently in patients treated with Savella (1%) than in placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Caution is advised in use of Savella in patients with a history of dysuria, notably in male patients with prostatic hypertrophy, prostatitis, and other lower urinary tract obstructive disorders. Male patients are more prone to genitourinary adverse effects, such as dysuria or urinary retention, and may experience testicular pain or ejaculation disorders.\n\n\n\n    5.12 Angle Closure Glaucoma\n\n\n\n  The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of SNRI drugs including Savella may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.\n\n\n\n    5.13 Concomitant Use with Alcohol\n\n\n\n  In clinical trials, more patients treated with Savella developed elevated transaminases than did placebo treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.6  )]  . Because it is possible that milnacipran may aggravate pre-existing liver disease, Savella should not be prescribed to patients with substantial alcohol use or evidence of chronic liver disease.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Liver injury: Limit treatment duration to 30 days. If hepatic injury is suspected, discontinue SAMSCA. Avoid use in patients with underlying liver disease. (  5.2  ) \n *  Dehydration and hypovolemia may require intervention (  5.3  ) \n *  Avoid use with hypertonic saline (  5.4  ) \n *  Avoid use with CYP 3A inducers and moderate CYP 3A inhibitors (  5.5  ) \n *  Consider dose reduction if co-administered with P-gp inhibitors (  5.5  ) \n *  Monitor serum potassium in patients with potassium >5 mEq/L or on drugs known to increase potassium (  5.6  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Too Rapid Correction of Serum Sodium Can Cause Serious Neurologic Sequelae\n\n\n\n   (see  BOXED WARNING  )  \n\n\n\n Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a risk associated with too rapid correction of hyponatremia (e.g., >12 mEq/L/24 hours). Osmotic demyelination results in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma or death. In susceptible patients, including those with severe malnutrition, alcoholism or advanced liver disease, slower rates of correction may be advisable. In controlled clinical trials in which tolvaptan was administered in titrated doses starting at 15 mg once daily, 7% of tolvaptan-treated subjects with a serum sodium <130 mEq/L had an increase in serum sodium greater than 8 mEq/L at approximately 8 hours and 2% had an increase greater than 12 mEq/L at 24 hours. Approximately 1% of placebo-treated subjects with a serum sodium <130 mEq/L had a rise greater than 8 mEq/L at 8 hours and no patient had a rise greater than 12 mEq/L/24 hours. Osmotic demyelination syndrome has been reported in association with SAMSCA therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  . Patients treated with SAMSCA should be monitored to assess serum sodium concentrations and neurologic status, especially during initiation and after titration. Subjects with SIADH or very low baseline serum sodium concentrations may be at greater risk for too-rapid correction of serum sodium. In patients receiving SAMSCA who develop too rapid a rise in serum sodium, discontinue or interrupt treatment with SAMSCA and consider administration of hypotonic fluid. Fluid restriction during the first 24 hours of therapy with SAMSCA may increase the likelihood of overly-rapid correction of serum sodium, and should generally be avoided.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Liver Injury\n\n\n\n   SAMSCA can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury. In a placebo-controlled and open label extension study of chronically administered tolvaptan in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, cases of serious liver injury attributed to tolvaptan were observed. An increased incidence of ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal was associated with tolvaptan (42/958 or 4.4%) compared to placebo (5/484 or 1.0%). Cases of serious liver injury were generally observed starting 3 months after initiation of tolvaptan although elevations of ALT occurred prior to 3 months.  \n\n\n\n  Patients with symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice should discontinue treatment with SAMSCA.  \n\n\n\n  Limit duration of therapy with SAMSCA to 30 days. Avoid use in patients with underlying liver disease, including cirrhosis, because the ability to recover from liver injury may be impaired [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Dehydration and Hypovolemia\n\n\n\n  SAMSCA therapy induces copious aquaresis, which is normally partially offset by fluid intake. Dehydration and hypovolemia can occur, especially in potentially volume-depleted patients receiving diuretics or those who are fluid restricted. In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials in which 607 hyponatremic patients were treated with tolvaptan, the incidence of dehydration was 3.3% for tolvaptan and 1.5% for placebo-treated patients. In patients receiving SAMSCA who develop medically significant signs or symptoms of hypovolemia, interrupt or discontinue SAMSCA therapy and provide supportive care with careful management of vital signs, fluid balance and electrolytes. Fluid restriction during therapy with SAMSCA may increase the risk of dehydration and hypovolemia. Patients receiving SAMSCA should continue ingestion of fluid in response to thirst.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Co-administration with Hypertonic Saline\n\n\n\n  Concomitant use with hypertonic saline is not recommended.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Drug Interactions\n\n\n\n   Other Drugs Affecting Exposure to Tolvaptan  \n\n\n\n   CYP 3A Inhibitors\n\n\n\n Tolvaptan is a substrate of CYP 3A. CYP 3A inhibitors can lead to a marked increase in tolvaptan concentrations [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].  Do not use SAMSCA with strong inhibitors of CYP 3A [see  Contraindications (4.4)  ]  and avoid concomitant use with moderate CYP 3A inhibitors.\n\n\n\n   CYP 3A Inducers\n\n\n\n Avoid co-administration of CYP 3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John's Wort) with SAMSCA, as this can lead to a reduction in the plasma concentration of tolvaptan and decreased effectiveness of SAMSCA treatment. If co-administered with CYP 3A inducers, the dose of SAMSCA may need to be increased [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n   P-gp Inhibitors\n\n\n\n The dose of SAMSCA may have to be reduced when SAMSCA is co-administered with P-gp inhibitors, e.g., cyclosporine [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.6 Hyperkalemia or Drugs that Increase Serum Potassium\n\n\n\n  Treatment with tolvaptan is associated with an acute reduction of the extracellular fluid volume which could result in increased serum potassium. Serum potassium levels should be monitored after initiation of tolvaptan treatment in patients with a serum potassium >5 mEq/L as well as those who are receiving drugs known to increase serum potassium levels.\n",

Patients should be monitored and instructed to report any symptoms without delay.  (5.1)   \n *  Intravitreal injection procedure associated effects (intraocular inflammation/infection, intraocular hemorrhage and increased IOP) may occur following an intravitreal injection. Patients should be monitored and instructed to report any symptoms without delay.  (5.2)   \n *  Potential for lens subluxation.  (5.3)   \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Decreased Vision\n\n\n\n  A decrease of >= 3 line of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was experienced by 5.6% of patients treated with JETREA and 3.2% of patients treated with vehicle in the controlled trials [see Clinical Studies  (14)  ]  .\n\n\n\n The majority of these decreases in vision were due to progression of the condition with traction and many required surgical intervention. Patients should be monitored appropriately [see Dosage and Administration  (2.4)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Intravitreal Injection Procedure Associated Effects\n\n\n\n  Intravitreal injections are associated with intraocular inflammation / infection, intraocular hemorrhage and increased intraocular pressure (IOP). In the controlled trials, intraocular inflammation occurred in 7.1% of patients injected with JETREA vs. 3.7% of patients injected with vehicle. Most of the post-injection intraocular inflammation events were mild and transient. Intraocular hemorrhage occurred in 2.4% vs. 3.7% of patients injected with JETREA vs. vehicle, respectively. Increased intraocular pressure occurred in 4.1% vs. 5.3% of patients injected with JETREA vs. vehicle, respectively.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Potential for Lens Subluxation\n\n\n\n  One case of lens subluxation was reported in a premature infant who received an intravitreal injection of 0.175 mg (1.4 times higher than the recommended dose) [see Pediatric Use  (8.4)  ]  . Lens subluxation was observed in three animal species (monkey, rabbit, minipig) following a single intravitreal injection that achieved vitreous concentrations of ocriplasmin 1.4 times higher than achieved with the recommended treatment dose. Administration of a second intravitreal dose in monkeys, 28 days apart, produced lens subluxation in 100% of the treated eyes [see Nonclinical Toxicology  (13.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4 Retinal Breaks\n\n\n\n  In the controlled trials, the incidence of retinal detachment was 0.9% in the JETREA group and 1.6% in the vehicle group, while the incidence of retinal tear (without detachment) was 1.1% in the JETREA group and 2.7% in the vehicle group. Most of these events occurred during or after vitrectomy in both groups. The incidence of retinal detachment that occurred pre-vitrectomy was 0.4% in the JETREA group and none in the vehicle group, while the incidence of retinal tear (without detachment) that occurred pre-vitrectomy was none in the JETREA group and 0.5% in the vehicle group.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Dyschromatopsia\n\n\n\n  Dyschromatopsia (generally described as yellowish vision) was reported in 2% of all patients injected with JETREA. In approximately half of these dyschromatopsia cases there were also electroretinographic (ERG) changes reported (a- and b-wave amplitude decrease).\n",

(5.1  ,  5.2  ,  5.3  ,  5.4  ,  5.6)  \n\n\n\n *    Immune-mediated pneumonitis: Withhold for moderate and permanently discontinue for severe or life-threatening pneumonitis.  (5.1)   \n *    Immune-mediated colitis: Withhold for moderate or severe and permanently discontinue for life-threatening colitis.  (5.2)   \n *    Immune-mediated hepatitis: Monitor for changes in liver function. Withhold for moderate and permanently discontinue for severe or life-threatening transaminase or total bilirubin elevation.  (5.3)   \n *    Immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction: Monitor for changes in renal function. Withhold for moderate or severe and permanently discontinue for life-threatening serum creatinine elevation.  (5.4)   \n *    Immune-mediated hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism: Monitor for changes in thyroid function. Initiate thyroid hormone replacement as needed.  (5.5)   \n *    Embryofetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception.  (5.7  ,  8.1  ,  8.3)   \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis\n\n\n\n  Severe pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, including fatal cases, occurred with OPDIVO treatment. Across the clinical trial experience in 691 patients with solid tumors, fatal immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 0.7% (5/691) of patients receiving OPDIVO. No cases of fatal pneumonitis occurred in Trial 1 or Trial 3; all five fatal cases occurred in a dose-finding study with OPDIVO doses of 1 mg/kg (two patients), 3 mg/kg (two patients), and 10 mg/kg (one patient).\n\n\n\n In Trial 1, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 3.4% (9/268) of patients receiving OPDIVO and none of the 102 patients receiving chemotherapy. Immune-mediated pneumonitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids and no clear alternate etiology, occurred in 2.2% (6/268) of patients receiving OPDIVO: one with Grade 3 and five with Grade 2 pneumonitis. The median time to onset for the six cases was 2.2 months (range: 25 days to 3.5 months). In two patients, pneumonitis was diagnosed after discontinuation of OPDIVO for other reasons, and Grade 2 pneumonitis led to interruption or permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in the remaining four patients. All six patients received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day); immune-mediated pneumonitis improved to Grade 0 or 1 with corticosteroids in all six patients. There were two patients with Grade 2 pneumonitis that completely resolved (defined as complete resolution of symptoms with completion of corticosteroids) and OPDIVO was restarted without recurrence of pneumonitis.\n\n\n\n  In Trial 3, pneumonitis occurred in 6% (7/117) of patients receiving OPDIVO, including five Grade 3 and two Grade 2 cases, all immune-mediated. The median time to onset was 3.3 months (range: 1.4 to 13.5 months). All seven patients discontinued OPDIVO for pneumonitis or another event and all seven patients experienced complete resolution of pneumonitis following receipt of high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents per day).  \n\n\n\n Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis, followed by corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue OPDIVO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) pneumonitis and withhold OPDIVO until resolution for moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Immune-Mediated Colitis\n\n\n\n  In Trial 1, diarrhea or colitis occurred in 21% (57/268) of patients receiving OPDIVO and 18% (18/102) of patients receiving chemotherapy. Immune-mediated colitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids with no clear alternate etiology, occurred in 2.2% (6/268) of patients receiving OPDIVO: five patients with Grade 3 and one patient with Grade 2 colitis. The median time to onset of immune-mediated colitis from initiation of OPDIVO was 2.5 months (range: 1 to 6 months). In three patients, colitis was diagnosed after discontinuation of OPDIVO for other reasons, and Grade 2 or 3 colitis led to interruption or permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in the remaining three patients. Five of these six patients received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents) for a median duration of 1.4 months (range: 3 days to 2.4 months) preceding corticosteroid taper. The sixth patient continued on low-dose corticosteroids started for another immune-mediated adverse reaction. Immune-mediated colitis improved to Grade 0 with corticosteroids in five patients, including one patient with Grade 3 colitis retreated after complete resolution (defined as improved to Grade 0 with completion of corticosteroids) without additional events of colitis. Grade 2 colitis was ongoing in one patient.\n\n\n\n  In Trial 3, diarrhea occurred in 21% (24/117) of patients. Immune-mediated colitis (Grade 3) occurred in 0.9% (1/117) of patients. The time to onset in this patient was 6.7 months. The patient received high-dose corticosteroids and was permanently discontinued from OPDIVO. Complete resolution occurred.  \n\n\n\n Monitor patients for immune-mediated colitis. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents followed by corticosteroid taper for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) colitis. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents followed by corticosteroid taper for moderate (Grade 2) colitis of more than 5 days duration; if worsening or no improvement occurs despite initiation of corticosteroids, increase dose to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents. Withhold OPDIVO for Grade 2 or 3 immune-mediated colitis. Permanently discontinue OPDIVO for Grade 4 colitis or for recurrent colitis upon restarting OPDIVO [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.3 Immune-Mediated Hepatitis\n\n\n\n  In Trial 1, there was an increased incidence of liver test abnormalities in the OPDIVO-treated group as compared to the chemotherapy-treated group, with increases in AST (28% vs. 12%), alkaline phosphatase (22% vs. 13%), ALT (16% vs. 5%), and total bilirubin (9% vs. 0). Immune-mediated hepatitis, defined as requirement for corticosteroids and no clear alternate etiology, occurred in 1.1% (3/268) of patients receiving OPDIVO: two patients with Grade 3 and one patient with Grade 2 hepatitis. The time to onset was 97, 113, and 86 days after initiation of OPDIVO. In one patient, hepatitis was diagnosed after discontinuation of OPDIVO for other reasons. In two patients, OPDIVO was withheld. All three patients received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents). Liver tests improved to Grade 1 within 4 to 15 days of initiation of corticosteroids. Immune-mediated hepatitis resolved and did not recur with continuation of corticosteroids in two patients; the third patient died of disease progression with persistent hepatitis. The two patients with Grade 3 hepatitis that resolved restarted OPDIVO and, in one patient, Grade 3 immune-mediated hepatitis recurred resulting in permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO.\n\n\n\n  In Trial 3, the incidences of increased liver test values were AST (16%), alkaline phosphatase (14%), ALT (12%), and total bilirubin (2.7%). No cases of immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in this trial.  \n\n\n\n Monitor patients for abnormal liver tests prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents for Grade 2 or greater transaminase elevations, with or without concomitant elevation in total bilirubin. Withhold OPDIVO for moderate (Grade 2) and permanently discontinue OPDIVO for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) immune-mediated hepatitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4 Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction\n\n\n\n  In Trial 1, there was an increased incidence of elevated creatinine in the OPDIVO-treated group as compared to the chemotherapy-treated group (13% vs. 9%). Grade 2 or 3 immune-mediated nephritis or renal dysfunction (defined as >= Grade 2 increased creatinine, requirement for corticosteroids, and no clear alternate etiology) occurred in 0.7% (2/268) of patients at 3.5 and 6 months after OPDIVO initiation, respectively. OPDIVO was permanently discontinued in both patients; both received high-dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents). Immune-mediated nephritis resolved and did not recur with continuation of corticosteroids in one patient. Renal dysfunction was ongoing in one patient.\n\n\n\n  In Trial 3, the incidence of elevated creatinine was 22%. Immune-mediated renal dysfunction (Grade 2) occurred in 0.9% (1/117) of patients. The time to onset in this patient was 0.8 months. The patient received high-dose corticosteroids. OPDIVO was withheld, and the patient discontinued due to disease progression prior to receiving additional OPDIVO. Immune-mediated renal dysfunction was ongoing.  \n\n\n\n Monitor patients for elevated serum creatinine prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents followed by corticosteroid taper for life-threatening (Grade 4) serum creatinine elevation and permanently discontinue OPDIVO. For severe (Grade 3) or moderate (Grade 2) serum creatinine elevation, withhold OPDIVO and administer corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents followed by corticosteroid taper; if worsening or no improvement occurs, increase dose of corticosteroids to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalents and permanently discontinue OPDIVO [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.5 Immune-Mediated Hypothyroidism and Hyperthyroidism\n\n\n\n  In Trial 1, where patients were evaluated at baseline and during the trial for thyroid function, Grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (21/268) of patients receiving OPDIVO and none of the 102 patients receiving chemotherapy. The median time to onset was 2.5 months (range: 24 days to 11.7 months). Seventeen of the 21 patients with hypothyroidism received levothyroxine. Fifteen of 17 patients received subsequent OPDIVO dosing while continuing to receive levothyroxine.\n\n\n\n Grade 1 or 2 hyperthyroidism occurred in 3% (8/268) of patients receiving OPDIVO and 1% (1/102) of patients receiving chemotherapy. The median time to onset in OPDIVO-treated patients was 1.6 months (range: 0 to 3.3 months). Four of five patients with Grade 1 hyperthyroidism and two of three patients with Grade 2 hyperthyroidism had documented resolution of hyperthyroidism; all three patients received medical management for Grade 2 hyperthyroidism.\n\n\n\n  In Trial 3, patients were evaluated for thyroid function at baseline, first day of treatment, and every 6 weeks. Hypothyroidism occurred in 4.3% (5/117) of patients. The median time to onset for these five cases was 4.1 months (range: 1.4 to 4.6 months). All five patients with hypothyroidism received levothyroxine. Complete resolution of hypothyroidism occurred in one patient allowing discontinuation of levothyroxine. Interruption of OPDIVO did not occur in these five patients.  \n\n\n\n  Hyperthyroidism occurred in 1.7% (2/117) of patients. One patient experienced Grade 2 hyperthyroidism 5.2 months after the first dose of OPDIVO, requiring treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and methimazole. Thyroid laboratory tests returned to normal 4.7 months later.  \n\n\n\n Monitor thyroid function prior to and periodically during treatment. Administer hormone replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Initiate medical management for control of hyperthyroidism. There are no recommended dose adjustments of OPDIVO for hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions\n\n\n\n  Other clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur. Immune-mediated adverse reactions may occur after discontinuation of OPDIVO therapy.\n\n\n\n The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 2% of OPDIVO-treated patients in Trials 1 and 3 (n=385): adrenal insufficiency, uveitis, pancreatitis, facial and abducens nerve paresis, demyelination, autoimmune neuropathy, motor dysfunction, and vasculitis.  \n\n\n\n Across clinical trials of OPDIVO administered at doses of 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg the following additional clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions were identified: hypophysitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, hypopituitarism, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and myasthenic syndrome.\n\n\n\n For any suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold OPDIVO, administer high-dose corticosteroids, and if appropriate, initiate hormone-replacement therapy. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider restarting OPDIVO after completion of corticosteroid taper based on the severity of the event [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.7 Embryofetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, OPDIVO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of nivolumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in increased abortion and premature infant death. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and for at least 5 months after the last dose of OPDIVO [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.3)  ]  .\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *     Thyroid C-cell Tumors: See Boxed Warning  (5.1)  . \n *     Pancreatitis: Postmarketing reports, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. Discontinue promptly if pancreatitis is suspected. Do not restart if pancreatitis is confirmed. Consider other antidiabetic therapies in patients with a history of pancreatitis  (5.2)  . \n *    Never share a Victoza pen between patients, even if the needle is changed  (5.3)  . \n *     Serious Hypoglycemia: Can occur when Victoza is used with an insulin secretagogue (e.g. a sulfonylurea) or insulin. Consider lowering the dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia  (5.4)  . \n *     Renal Impairment: Has been reported postmarketing, usually in association with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration which may sometimes require hemodialysis. Use caution when initiating or escalating doses of Victoza in patients with renal impairment  (5.5)  . \n *     Hypersensitivity: Postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema). The patient should discontinue Victoza and other suspect medications and promptly seek medical advice  (5.6)  . \n *     Macrovascular Outcomes: There have been no studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Victoza or any other antidiabetic drug  (5.7)  . \n    \n \n\n    5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors  \n\n\n\n   Liraglutide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) at clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  . Malignant thyroid C-cell carcinomas were detected in rats and mice. It is unknown whether Victoza will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of liraglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.  \n\n\n\n  Cases of MTC in patients treated with Victoza have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and Victoza use in humans.  \n\n\n\n  Victoza is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of Victoza and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g. a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).  \n\n\n\n  Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with Victoza. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Pancreatitis\n\n\n\n   Based on spontaneous postmarketing reports, acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with Victoza. After initiation of Victoza, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, Victoza should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. If pancreatitis is confirmed, Victoza should not be restarted. Consider antidiabetic therapies other than Victoza in patients with a history of pancreatitis.  \n\n\n\n In clinical trials of Victoza, there have been 13 cases of pancreatitis among Victoza-treated patients and 1 case in a comparator (glimepiride) treated patient (2.7 vs. 0.5 cases per 1000 patient-years). Nine of the 13 cases with Victoza were reported as acute pancreatitis and four were reported as chronic pancreatitis. In one case in a Victoza-treated patient, pancreatitis, with necrosis, was observed and led to death; however clinical causality could not be established. Some patients had other risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Never Share a Victoza Pen Between Patients\n\n\n\n  Victoza pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen-sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia\n\n\n\n  Patients receiving Victoza in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) or insulin [  see Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.5 Renal Impairment\n\n\n\n  Victoza has not been found to be directly nephrotoxic in animal studies or clinical trials. There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis in Victoza-treated patients   [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]    . Some of these events were reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration   [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]    . Some of the reported events occurred in patients receiving one or more medications known to affect renal function or hydration status. Altered renal function has been reversed in many of the reported cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including Victoza. Use caution when initiating or escalating doses of Victoza in patients with renal impairment   [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]    .\n\n\n\n    5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema) in patients treated with Victoza. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the patient should discontinue Victoza and other suspect medications and promptly seek medical advice.\n\n\n\n Angioedema has also been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with Victoza.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\n\n\n  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Victoza or any other antidiabetic drug.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    CABG-related bleeding: Risk increases in patients receiving Effient who undergo CABG (  5.2  ). \n *    Discontinuation of Effient: Premature discontinuation increases risk of stent thrombosis, MI, and death (  5.3  ). \n *    Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported with Effient (  5.4  ). \n *    Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity including angioedema has been reported with Effient including in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to other thienopyridines (  5.5  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 General Risk of Bleeding\n\n\n\n  Thienopyridines, including Effient, increase the risk of bleeding. With the dosing regimens used in TRITON-TIMI 38, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Major (clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin >=5 g/dL, or intracranial hemorrhage) and TIMI Minor (overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin of >=3 g/dL but <5 g/dL) bleeding events were more common on Effient than on clopidogrel [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . The bleeding risk is highest initially, as shown in  Figure 1  (events through 450 days; inset shows events through 7 days).\n\n\n\n Figure 1: Non-CABG-Related TIMI Major or Minor Bleeding Events.   Figure 1: Non-CABG-Related TIMI Major or Minor Bleeding Events.\n \n\n Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures even if the patient does not have overt signs of bleeding.\n\n\n\n Do not use Effient in patients with active bleeding, prior TIA or stroke [see Contraindications (  4.1  ,  4.2  )]  .\n\n\n\n Other risk factors for bleeding are:\n\n\n\n *    Age >=75 years. Because of the risk of bleeding (including fatal bleeding) and uncertain effectiveness in patients >=75 years of age, use of Effient is generally not recommended in these patients, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or history of myocardial infarction) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  ), Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  ), and Clinical Trials (  14  )] . \n *    CABG or other surgical procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )] . \n *    Body weight <60 kg. Consider a lower (5-mg) maintenance dose [see Dosage and Administration (  2  ), Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ), and Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )] . \n *    Propensity to bleed (e.g., recent trauma, recent surgery, recent or recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, active peptic ulcer disease, severe hepatic impairment, or moderate to severe renal impairment) [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.7  ,  8.8  )] . \n *    Medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., oral anticoagulants, chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and fibrinolytic agents). Aspirin and heparin were commonly used in TRITON-TIMI 38 [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  ,  7.2  .  7.3  ), and Clinical Studies (  14  )] . \n    Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7-10 days), so withholding a dose will not be useful in managing a bleeding event or the risk of bleeding associated with an invasive procedure. Because the half-life of prasugrel's active metabolite is short relative to the lifetime of the platelet, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 6 hours of the loading dose or 4 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.\n \n\n  Figure 1    5.2 Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery-Related Bleeding\n\n\n\n  The risk of bleeding is increased in patients receiving Effient who undergo CABG. If possible, Effient should be discontinued at least 7 days prior to CABG.\n\n\n\n Of the 437 patients who underwent CABG during TRITON-TIMI 38, the rates of CABG-related TIMI Major or Minor bleeding were 14.1% in the Effient group and 4.5% in the clopidogrel group [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . The higher risk for bleeding events in patients treated with Effient persisted up to 7 days from the most recent dose of study drug. For patients receiving a thienopyridine within 3 days prior to CABG, the frequencies of TIMI Major or Minor bleeding were 26.7% (12 of 45 patients) in the Effient group, compared with 5.0% (3 of 60 patients) in the clopidogrel group. For patients who received their last dose of thienopyridine within 4 to 7 days prior to CABG, the frequencies decreased to 11.3% (9 of 80 patients) in the prasugrel group and 3.4% (3 of 89 patients) in the clopidogrel group.\n\n\n\n Do not start Effient in patients likely to undergo urgent CABG. CABG-related bleeding may be treated with transfusion of blood products, including packed red blood cells and platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 6 hours of the loading dose or 4 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Discontinuation of Effient\n\n\n\n  Discontinue thienopyridines, including Effient, for active bleeding, elective surgery, stroke, or TIA. The optimal duration of thienopyridine therapy is unknown. In patients who are managed with PCI and stent placement, premature discontinuation of any antiplatelet medication, including thienopyridines, conveys an increased risk of stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and death. Patients who require premature discontinuation of a thienopyridine will be at increased risk for cardiac events. Lapses in therapy should be avoided, and if thienopyridines must be temporarily discontinued because of an adverse event(s), they should be restarted as soon as possible [see Contraindications (  4.1  ,  4.2  ) and Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\n\n\n\n  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has been reported with the use of Effient. TTP can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks). TTP is a serious condition that can be fatal and requires urgent treatment, including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange). TTP is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes [fragment red blood cells] seen on peripheral smear), neurological findings, renal dysfunction, and fever [see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Hypersensitivity Including Angioedema\n\n\n\n  Hypersensitivity including angioedema has been reported in patients receiving Effient, including patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to other thienopyridines [see Contraindications (  4.3  ) and Adverse Reactions (  6.2  )]  .\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *     Hypersensitivity Reactions (including anaphylaxis) : Discontinue ENTYVIO if anaphylaxis or other serious allergic reactions occur. (  5.1  ) \n *     Infections : Treatment with ENTYVIO is not recommended in patients with active, severe infections until the infections are controlled. Consider withholding ENTYVIO in patients who develop a severe infection while on treatment with ENTYVIO. (  5.2  ) \n *     Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy: Although no cases have been observed in ENTYVIO clinical trials, JCV infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and death has occurred in patients treated with another integrin receptor antagonist. A risk of PML cannot be ruled out. Monitor patients for any new or worsening neurological signs or symptoms. (  5.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Infusion-Related Reactions and Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  In UC Trials I and II and CD Trials I and III, hypersensitivity reactions occurred including a case of anaphylaxis (one out of 1434 patients [0.07%]) [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Allergic reactions including dyspnea, bronchospasm, urticaria, flushing, rash, and increased blood pressure and heart rate have also been observed. The majority were mild to moderate in severity as assessed by the investigator. Experience with other biologic medications suggests that hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis to ENTYVIO may vary in their time of onset from during infusion or immediately post-infusion to occurring up to several hours post-infusion.\n\n\n\n If anaphylaxis or other serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue administration of ENTYVIO immediately and initiate appropriate treatment (e.g., epinephrine and antihistamines).\n\n\n\n    5.2 Infections\n\n\n\n  Patients treated with ENTYVIO are at increased risk for developing infections [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . The most commonly reported infections in clinical trials occurring at a rate greater on ENTYVIO than placebo involved the upper respiratory and nasal mucosa (e.g., nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection). Serious infections have also been reported in patients treated with ENTYVIO, including anal abscess, sepsis (some fatal), tuberculosis, salmonella sepsis, Listeria meningitis, giardiasis and cytomegaloviral colitis.\n\n\n\n ENTYVIO is not recommended in patients with active, severe infections until the infections are controlled. Consider withholding treatment in patients who develop a severe infection while on treatment with ENTYVIO. Exercise caution when considering the use of ENTYVIO in patients with a history of recurring severe infections. Consider screening for tuberculosis (TB) according to the local practice. For progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), see Warnings and Precautions (  5.3    ).\n\n\n\n    5.3 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy\n\n\n\n  Another integrin receptor antagonist has been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare and often fatal opportunistic infection of the central nervous system (CNS). PML is caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus and typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised.\n\n\n\n In ENTYVIO clinical trials, patients were actively monitored for PML with frequent and regular screenings, and evaluations of any new, unexplained neurological symptoms, as necessary. While zero cases of PML were identified among patients with at least 24 months of exposure, a risk of PML cannot be ruled out. No claims of comparative safety to other integrin receptor antagonists can be made based on this data.\n\n\n\n Monitor patients on ENTYVIO for any new onset, or worsening, of neurological signs and symptoms. Typical signs and symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. The progression of deficits usually leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months. If PML is suspected, withhold dosing with ENTYVIO and refer to a neurologist; if confirmed, discontinue dosing permanently.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Liver Injury\n\n\n\n  There have been reports of elevations of transaminase and/or bilirubin in patients receiving ENTYVIO. In general, the combination of transaminase elevations and elevated bilirubin without evidence of obstruction is generally recognized as an important predictor of severe liver injury that may lead to death or the need for a liver transplant in some patients. ENTYVIO should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or other evidence of significant liver injury [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Live and Oral Vaccines\n\n\n\n  Prior to initiating treatment with ENTYVIO, all patients should be brought up to date with all immunizations according to current immunization guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  . Patients receiving ENTYVIO may receive non-live vaccines (e.g., influenza vaccine injection) and may receive live vaccines if the benefits outweigh the risks. There are no data on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving ENTYVIO [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .\n",

If confirmed, discontinue treatment (5.5) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Adempas may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy and is contraindicated for use in women who are pregnant. In females of reproductive potential, exclude pregnancy prior to initiation of therapy, advise use of acceptable contraception and obtain monthly pregnancy tests. For Female, Adempas is only available through a restricted program under the Adempas REMS Program [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  ), Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.6  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Adempas REMS Program\n\n\n\n  Females can only receive Adempas through the Adempas Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program, a restricted distribution program [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )].  \n\n\n\n Important requirements of the Adempas REMS Program include the following:\n\n\n\n *    Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training. \n *    All females, regardless of reproductive potential, must enroll in the Adempas REMS Program prior to initiating Adempas. Male patients are not enrolled in the Adempas REMS Program. \n *    Female patients of reproductive potential must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].  \n *    Pharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive Adempas. \n    Further information, including a list of certified pharmacies, is available at www.AdempasREMS.com or 1-855-4 ADEMPAS.\n \n\n    5.3 Hypotension\n\n\n\n  Adempas reduces blood pressure. Consider the potential for symptomatic hypotension or ischemia in patients with hypovolemia, severe left ventricular outflow obstruction, resting hypotension, autonomic dysfunction, or concomitant treatment with antihypertensives or strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (  7.2  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  . Consider a dose reduction if patient develops signs or symptoms of hypotension.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Bleeding\n\n\n\n  In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, serious bleeding occurred in 2.4% of patients taking Adempas compared to 0% of placebo patients. Serious hemoptysis occurred in 5 (1%) patients taking Adempas compared to 0 placebo patients, including one event with fatal outcome. Serious hemorrhagic events also included 2 patients with vaginal hemorrhage, 2 with catheter site hemorrhage, and 1 each with subdural hematoma, hematemesis, and intra-abdominal hemorrhage.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease\n\n\n\n  Pulmonary vasodilators may significantly worsen the cardiovascular status of patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD). Therefore, administration of Adempas to such patients is not recommended. Should signs of pulmonary edema occur, the possibility of associated PVOD should be considered and, if confirmed, discontinue treatment with Adempas.\n",

Monitor for symptoms of opioid withdrawal  (5.2)   \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Gastrointestinal Perforation\n\n\n\n  Cases of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported with use of another peripherally acting opioid antagonist in patients with conditions that may be associated with localized or diffuse reduction of structural integrity in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., peptic ulcer disease, Ogilvie's syndrome, diverticular disease, infiltrative gastrointestinal tract malignancies or peritoneal metastases). Take into account the overall risk-benefit profile when using MOVANTIK in patients with these conditions or other conditions which might result in impaired integrity of the gastrointestinal tract wall (e.g., Crohn's disease). Monitor for the development of severe, persistent or worsening abdominal pain; discontinue MOVANTIK in patients who develop this symptom [ see     Contraindications (4)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.2 Opioid Withdrawal\n\n\n\n  Clusters of symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, including hyperhidrosis, chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anxiety, irritability, and yawning have occurred in patients treated with MOVANTIK [ see     Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. In addition, patients receiving methadone as therapy for their pain condition were observed in clinical trials to have a higher frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions that may have been related to opioid withdrawal than patients receiving other opioids [ see     Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Patients having disruptions to the blood-brain barrier may be at increased risk for opioid withdrawal or reduced analgesia. Take into account the overall risk-benefit profile when using MOVANTIK in such patients. Monitor for symptoms of opioid withdrawal in such patients.\n",

(  5.2  ) \n *    Dermatological toxicity: Interrupt and then reduce or discontinue Stivarga depending on severity and persistence of dermatologic toxicity. (  5.3  ) \n *    Hypertension: Temporarily or permanently discontinue Stivarga for severe or uncontrolled hypertension. (  5.4  ) \n *    Cardiac ischemia and infarction: Withhold Stivarga for new or acute cardiac ischemia/infarction and resume only after resolution of acute ischemic events. (  5.5  ) \n *    Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS): Discontinue Stivarga. (  5.6  ) \n *    Gastrointestinal perforation or fistulae: Discontinue Stivarga. (  5.7  ) \n *    Wound healing complications: Stop Stivarga before surgery. Discontinue in patients with wound dehiscence. (  5.8  ) \n *    Embryofetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to a fetus. (  5.9  ,  8.1  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hepatotoxicity\n\n\n\n  Severe drug induced liver injury with fatal outcome occurred in 0.3% of 1200 Stivarga-treated patients across all clinical trials. Liver biopsy results, when available, showed hepatocyte necrosis with lymphocyte infiltration. In Study 1, fatal hepatic failure occurred in 1.6% of patients in the regorafenib arm and in 0.4% of patients in the placebo arm; all the patients with hepatic failure had metastatic disease in the liver. In Study 2, fatal hepatic failure occurred in 0.8% of patients in the regorafenib arm [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .\n\n\n\n Obtain liver function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) before initiation of Stivarga and monitor at least every two weeks during the first 2 months of treatment. Thereafter, monitor monthly or more frequently as clinically indicated. Monitor liver function tests weekly in patients experiencing elevated liver function tests until improvement to less than 3 times the ULN or baseline.\n\n\n\n Temporarily hold and then reduce or permanently discontinue Stivarga depending on the severity and persistence of hepatotoxicity as manifested by elevated liver function tests or hepatocellular necrosis [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Hemorrhage\n\n\n\n  Stivarga caused an increased incidence of hemorrhage. The overall incidence (Grades 1-5) was 21% and 11% in Stivarga-treated patients compared to 8% and 3% in placebo-treated patients in Studies 1 and 2. Fatal hemorrhage occurred in 4 of 632 (0.6%) of Stivarga-treated patients in Studies 1 and 2 and involved the respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tracts.\n\n\n\n Permanently discontinue Stivarga in patients with severe or life-threatening hemorrhage. Monitor INR levels more frequently in patients receiving warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.3 Dermatological Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Stivarga caused increased incidences of adverse reactions involving the skin and subcutaneous tissues (72% versus 24% in Study 1 and 78% versus 24% in Study 2), including hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), and severe rash requiring dose modification.\n\n\n\n The overall incidence of HFSR was higher in Stivarga-treated patients, (45% versus 7% in Study 1 and 67% versus 12% in Study 2), than in the placebo-treated patients. Most cases of HFSR in Stivarga-treated patients appeared during the first cycle of treatment (69% and 71% of patients who developed HFSR in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively). The incidence of Grade 3 HFSR (17% versus 0% in Study 1 and 22% versus 0% in Study 2), Grade 3 rash (6% versus <1% in Study 1 and 7% versus 0% in Study 2), serious adverse reactions of erythema multiforme (0.2% vs. 0% in Study 1) and Stevens Johnson Syndrome (0.2% vs. 0% in Study 1) was higher in Stivarga-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .\n\n\n\n Toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred in 0.17% of 1200 Stivarga-treated patients across all clinical trials.\n\n\n\n Withhold Stivarga, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue Stivarga depending on the severity and persistence of dermatologic toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  . Institute supportive measures for symptomatic relief.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Hypertension\n\n\n\n  Stivarga caused an increased incidence of hypertension (30% versus 8% in Study 1 and 59% versus 27% in Study 2) [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Hypertensive crisis occurred in 0.25% of 1200 Stivarga-treated patients across all clinical trials. The onset of hypertension occurred during the first cycle of treatment in most patients who developed hypertension (72% in Study 1 and Study 2).\n\n\n\n Do not initiate Stivarga unless blood pressure is adequately controlled. Monitor blood pressure weekly for the first 6 weeks of treatment and then every cycle, or more frequently, as clinically indicated. Temporarily or permanently withhold Stivarga for severe or uncontrolled hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Cardiac Ischemia and Infarction\n\n\n\n  Stivarga increased the incidence of myocardial ischemia and infarction in Study 1 (1.2% versus 0.4%) [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Withhold Stivarga in patients who develop new or acute onset cardiac ischemia or infarction. Resume Stivarga only after resolution of acute cardiac ischemic events, if the potential benefits outweigh the risks of further cardiac ischemia.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS)\n\n\n\n  Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS), a syndrome of subcortical vasogenic edema diagnosed by characteristic finding on MRI, occurred in one of 1200 Stivarga-treated patients across all clinical trials. Perform an evaluation for RPLS in any patient presenting with seizures, headache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. Discontinue Stivarga in patients who develop RPLS.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Gastrointestinal Perforation or Fistula\n\n\n\n  Gastrointestinal perforation or fistula occurred in 0.6% of 1200 patients treated with Stivarga across all clinical trials; this included four fatal events. In Study 2, 2.1% (4/188) of Stivarga-treated patients who were treated during the blinded or open-label portion of the study developed gastrointestinal fistula or perforation; of these, two cases of gastrointestinal perforation were fatal. Permanently discontinue Stivarga in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation or fistula.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Wound Healing Complications\n\n\n\n  No formal studies of the effect of regorafenib on wound healing have been conducted. Since vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors such as regorafenib can impair wound healing, treatment with regorafenib should be stopped at least 2 weeks prior to scheduled surgery. The decision to resume regorafenib after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. Regorafenib should be discontinued in patients with wound dehiscence.\n\n\n\n    5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Stivarga can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Regorafenib was embryolethal and teratogenic in rats and rabbits at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended dose, with increased incidences of cardiovascular, genitourinary, and skeletal malformations. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )]  .\n",

(  5.1  ) \n *    Do not initiate in acutely deteriorating COPD or to treat acute symptoms. (  5.2  ) \n *    Do not use in combination with an additional medicine containing LABA because of risk of overdose. (  5.3  ) \n *    If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue ANORO ELLIPTA and institute alternative therapy. (  5.5  ) \n *    Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders (  5.7  ) \n *    Use with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus, and ketoacidosis. (  5.8  ) \n *    Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to contact a physician immediately if symptoms occur. (  5.9  ) \n *    Worsening of urinary retention may occur. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patients to contact a physician immediately if symptoms occur. (  5.10  ) \n *    Be alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. (  5.11  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Asthma-Related Death\n\n\n\n    *    Data from a large placebo-controlled trial in subjects with asthma showed that LABA may increase the risk of asthma-related death. Data are not available to determine whether the rate of death in patients with COPD is increased by LABA. \n *    A 28-week, placebo-controlled, US trial comparing the safety of another LABA (salmeterol) with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in subjects treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in subjects treated with placebo; relative risk: 4.37 [95% CI: 1.25, 15.34]). The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of LABA, including vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in ANORO ELLIPTA. \n *    No trial adequate to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased in subjects treated with ANORO ELLIPTA has been conducted. The safety and efficacy of ANORO ELLIPTA in patients with asthma have not been established. ANORO ELLIPTA is not indicated for the treatment of asthma. \n       5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes\n \n\n  ANORO ELLIPTA should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of COPD. ANORO ELLIPTA has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating COPD. The initiation of ANORO ELLIPTA in this setting is not appropriate.\n\n\n\n ANORO ELLIPTA should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. ANORO ELLIPTA has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist.\n\n\n\n When beginning treatment with ANORO ELLIPTA, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and to use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing ANORO ELLIPTA, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. Increasing inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist use is a signal of deteriorating disease for which prompt medical attention is indicated.\n\n\n\n COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If ANORO ELLIPTA no longer controls symptoms of bronchoconstriction; the patient's inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist becomes less effective; or the patient needs more short-acting beta2-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting a re-evaluation of the patient and the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. Increasing the daily dose of ANORO ELLIPTA beyond the recommended dose is not appropriate in this situation.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Excessive Use of ANORO ELLIPTA and Use With Other Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists\n\n\n\n  ANORO ELLIPTA should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medicines containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using ANORO ELLIPTA should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Drug Interactions With Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors\n\n\n\n  Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of ANORO ELLIPTA with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole) because increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Paradoxical Bronchospasm\n\n\n\n  As with other inhaled medicines, ANORO ELLIPTA can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with ANORO ELLIPTA, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; ANORO ELLIPTA should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of ANORO ELLIPTA. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of other powder products containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use ANORO ELLIPTA [see Contraindications (4)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.7 Cardiovascular Effects\n\n\n\n  Vilanterol, like other beta2-agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, or symptoms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]  . If such effects occur, ANORO ELLIPTA may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiographic changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression, although the clinical significance of these findings is unknown.\n\n\n\n Therefore, ANORO ELLIPTA should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Coexisting Conditions\n\n\n\n  ANORO ELLIPTA, like all medicines containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta2-adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.\n\n\n\n    5.9 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma\n\n\n\n  ANORO ELLIPTA should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if any of these signs or symptoms develops.\n\n\n\n    5.10 Worsening of Urinary Retention\n\n\n\n  ANORO ELLIPTA should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of urinary retention (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination), especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction. Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if any of these signs or symptoms develops .  \n\n\n\n    5.11 Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia\n\n\n\n  Beta-adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Beta-agonist medicines may produce transient hyperglycemia in some patients. In 4 clinical trials of 6-month duration evaluating ANORO ELLIPTA in subjects with COPD, there was no evidence of a treatment effect on serum glucose or potassium.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Monitor patients for suicidal behavior and ideation (  5.1  ) \n *  VIMPAT may cause dizziness and ataxia (  5.2  ) \n *  Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities: ECG before beginning VIMPAT, and after VIMPAT is titrated to steady-state maintenance dose is recommended in patients with known cardiac conduction problems, taking drugs known to induce PR interval prolongation, or with severe cardiac disease (  5.3  ) \n *  VIMPAT may cause syncope (  5.4  ) \n *  VIMPAT should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency (  5.5  ) \n *  Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions (  5.6  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation\n\n\n\n  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including VIMPAT, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.\n\n\n\n Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\n\n\n\n The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.\n\n\n\n The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.\n\n\n\n Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.\n\n\n\n Table 1 Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis \n Indication            Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients  Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients  Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients  Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients   \n  \n Epilepsy                      1.0                   3.4                   3.5                   2.4            \n Psychiatric                   5.7                   8.5                   1.5                   2.9            \n Other                         1.0                   1.8                   1.9                   0.9            \n Total                         2.4                   4.3                   1.8                   1.9            \n           The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar.\n \n\n Anyone considering prescribing VIMPAT or any other AED must balance this risk with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which antiepileptics are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.\n\n\n\n Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Dizziness and Ataxia\n\n\n\n  VIMPAT may cause dizziness and ataxia.\n\n\n\n In patients with partial-onset seizures taking 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs, dizziness was experienced by 25% of patients randomized to the recommended doses (200 to 400 mg/day) of VIMPAT (compared with 8% of placebo patients) and was the adverse event most frequently leading to discontinuation (3%). Ataxia was experienced by 6% of patients randomized to the recommended doses (200 to 400 mg/day) of VIMPAT (compared to 2% of placebo patients). The onset of dizziness and ataxia was most commonly observed during titration. There was a substantial increase in these adverse events at doses higher than 400 mg/day [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.3 Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities\n\n\n\n   PR interval prolongation  \n\n\n\n Dose-dependent prolongations in PR interval with VIMPAT have been observed in clinical studies in patients and in healthy volunteers [ see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)    ]. In adjunctive clinical trials in patients with partial-onset epilepsy, asymptomatic first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block was observed as an adverse reaction in 0.4% (4/944) of patients randomized to receive VIMPAT and 0% (0/364) of patients randomized to receive placebo. In clinical trials in patients with diabetic neuropathy, asymptomatic first-degree AV block was observed as an adverse reaction in 0.5% (5/1023) of patients receiving VIMPAT and 0% (0/291) of patients receiving placebo. Second degree and complete AV block have been reported in patients in pain studies and in patients with seizures. When VIMPAT is given with other drugs that prolong the PR interval, further PR prolongation is possible.\n\n\n\n  VIMPAT should be used with caution in patients with known conduction problems (e.g., marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block and sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker), sodium channelopathies (e.g., Brugada Syndrome), on concomitant medications that prolong PR interval, or with severe cardiac disease such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure, or structural heart disease. In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning VIMPAT, and after VIMPAT is titrated to steady-state maintenance dose, is recommended. In addition, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered VIMPAT through the intravenous route. One case of profound bradycardia was observed in a patient during a 15-minute infusion of 150 mg VIMPAT. There were two postmarketing reports of third degree AV block in patients with significant cardiac history and also receiving metoprolol and amlodipine during infusion of VIMPAT injection at doses higher than recommended [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ].    \n\n\n\n    Atrial fibrillation and Atrial flutter  \n\n\n\n In the short-term investigational trials of VIMPAT in epilepsy patients, there were no cases of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in open label epilepsy trials and in postmarketing experience. In patients with diabetic neuropathy, 0.5% of patients treated with VIMPAT experienced an adverse reaction of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. VIMPAT administration may predispose to atrial arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or flutter), especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy and/or cardiovascular disease.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Syncope\n\n\n\n   In the short-term controlled trials of VIMPAT in epilepsy patients with no significant system illnesses, there was no increase in syncope compared to placebo. In the short-term controlled trials of VIMPAT in patients with diabetic neuropathy, 1.2% of patients who were treated with VIMPAT reported an adverse reaction of syncope or loss of consciousness, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients with diabetic neuropathy. Most of the cases of syncope were observed in patients receiving doses above 400 mg/day. The cause of syncope was not determined in most cases. However, several were associated with either changes in orthostatic blood pressure, atrial flutter/fibrillation (and associated tachycardia), or bradycardia. Cases of syncope have also been observed in open-label clinical epilepsy studies. These cases were associated with a history of risk factors for cardiac disease and the use of drugs that slow AV conduction.  \n\n\n\n    5.5 Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)\n\n\n\n  As with all AEDs, VIMPAT should be withdrawn gradually (over a minimum of 1 week) to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  One case of symptomatic hepatitis and nephritis was observed among 4011 subjects exposed to VIMPAT during clinical development. The event occurred in a healthy volunteer, 10 days after stopping VIMPAT treatment. The subject was not taking any concomitant medication and potential known viral etiologies for hepatitis were ruled out. The subject fully recovered within a month, without specific treatment. The case is consistent with a delayed multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction. Additional potential cases included 2 with rash and elevated liver enzymes and 1 with myocarditis and hepatitis of uncertain etiology.\n\n\n\n Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (also known as D  rug R  eaction with E  osinophilia and S  ystemic S  ymptoms, or DRESS) have been reported with other antiepileptics and typically, although not exclusively, present with fever and rash associated with other organ system involvement, that may or may not include eosinophilia, hepatitis, nephritis, lymphadenopathy, and/or myocarditis. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ system signs and symptoms not noted here may occur. If this reaction is suspected, VIMPAT should be discontinued and alternative treatment started.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Phenylketonurics\n\n\n\n  VIMPAT oral solution contains aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. A 200 mg dose of VIMPAT oral solution (equivalent to 20 mL) contains 0.32 mg of phenylalanine.\n",

        "section_text": "     5        WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Monitor patients for new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts/behavior, and unusual changes in mood or behavior (  5.1  ) \n *  Central nervous system reactions can occur (  5.2  ) \n *  Use caution when administering BANZEL with other drugs that shorten the QT interval (  5.3  ) \n *  Discontinue BANZEL if multi-organ hypersensitivity reaction occurs (  5.4  ) \n *  Withdraw BANZEL gradually to minimize the risk of precipitating seizures, seizure exacerbation, or status epilepticus (  5.5  ) \n    \n \n\n    5.1        Suicidal Behavior and Ideation  \n\n\n\n  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including BANZEL, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.\n\n\n\n Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\n\n\n\n The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.\n\n\n\n The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.\n\n\n\n Table 1: Absolute and Relative Risk of Suicidal Behavior and Ideation \n Indication       Placebo Patients with EventsPer 1000 Patients  Drug Patientswith Events Per1000 Patients  Relative Risk:Incidence ofEvents in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients  Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients   \n Epilepsy         1.0              3.4              3.5              2.4               \n Psychiatric      5.7              8.5              1.5              2.9               \n Other            1.0              1.8              1.9              0.9               \n Total            2.4              4.3              1.8              1.9               \n           The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.\n \n\n Anyone considering prescribing BANZEL or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.\n\n\n\n Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.\n\n\n\n     5.2        C   entral Nervous System Reactions  \n\n\n\n  Use of BANZEL has been associated with central nervous system-related adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial of patients 4 years or older with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. The most significant of these can be classified into two general categories: 1) somnolence or fatigue, and 2) coordination abnormalities, dizziness, gait disturbances, and ataxia.\n\n\n\n Somnolence was reported in 24% of BANZEL-treated patients compared to 13% of patients on placebo, and led to study discontinuation in 3% of BANZEL-treated patients compared to 0% of patients on placebo. Fatigue was reported in 10% of BANZEL-treated patients compared to 8% of patients on placebo patients. It led to study discontinuation in 1% of BANZEL-treated patients and 0% of patients on placebo patients.\n\n\n\n Dizziness was reported in 2.7% of BANZEL-treated patients compared to 0% of patients on placebo, and did not lead to study discontinuation.\n\n\n\n Ataxia and gait disturbance were reported in 5.4% and 1.4% of BANZEL-treated patients, respectively, compared to no patient on placebo. None of these reactions led to study discontinuation.\n\n\n\n Accordingly, patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on BANZEL to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.\n\n\n\n     5.3        QT Shortening  \n\n\n\n  Formal cardiac ECG studies demonstrated shortening of the QT interval (mean = 20 msec, for doses >  2400 mg twice daily) with BANZEL. In a placebo-controlled study of the QT interval, a higher percentage of BANZEL-treated subjects (46% at 2400 mg, 46% at 3200 mg, and 65% at 4800 mg) had a QT shortening of greater than 20 msec at Tmaxcompared to placebo (5-10%). \n\n\n\n Reductions of the QT interval below 300 msec were not observed in the formal QT studies with doses up to 7200 mg per day. Moreover, there was no signal for drug-induced sudden death or ventricular arrhythmias.\n\n\n\n The degree of QT shortening induced by BANZEL is without any known clinical risk.  Familial Short QT syndrome is associated with an increased risk of sudden death and ventricular arrhythmias, particularly ventricular fibrillation.  Such events in this syndrome are believed to occur primarily when the corrected QT interval falls below 300 msec. Non-clinical data also indicate that QT shortening is associated with ventricular fibrillation.\n\n\n\n Patients with Familial Short QT syndrome should not be treated with BANZEL. Caution should be used when administering BANZEL with other drugs that shorten the QT interval [ see   Contraindications   (     4     )  ]. \n\n\n\n     5.4        Multi-organ Hypersensitivity   /Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)  \n\n\n\n  Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including BANZEL.  DRESS may be fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident.  Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. \n\n\n\n All cases of DRESS identified in clinical trials with BANZEL occurred in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, occurred within 4 weeks of treatment initiation, and resolved or improved with BANZEL discontinuation. DRESS has also been reported in adult and pediatric patients taking BANZEL in the postmarketing setting.\n\n\n\n If DRESS is suspected, the patient should be evaluated immediately, BANZEL should be discontinued, and alternative treatment should be started.\n\n\n\n     5.5        Withdrawal of AEDs  \n\n\n\n  As with all antiepileptic drugs, BANZEL should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the risk of precipitating seizures, seizure exacerbation, or status epilepticus. If abrupt discontinuation of the drug is medically necessary, the transition to another AED should be made under close medical supervision. In clinical trials, BANZEL discontinuation was achieved by reducing the dose by approximately 25% every 2 days.\n\n\n\n     5.6        Status Epilepticus  \n\n\n\n  Estimates of the incidence of treatment emergent status epilepticus among patients treated with BANZEL are difficult because standard definitions were not employed. In a controlled Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome trial, 3 of 74 (4.1%) BANZEL-treated patients had episodes that could be described as status epilepticus in the BANZEL-treated patients compared with none of the 64 patients in the placebo-treated patients. In all controlled trials that included patients with different epilepsies, 11 of 1240 (0.9%) BANZEL-treated patients had episodes that could be described as status epilepticus compared with none of 635 patients in the placebo-treated patients.\n\n\n\n     5.7        Leukopenia  \n\n\n\n  BANZEL has been shown to reduce white cell count. Leukopenia (white cell count < 3X10  9  L) was more commonly observed in BANZEL-treated patients 43 of 1171 (3.7%) than placebo-treated patients, 7 of 579 (1.2%) in all controlled trials.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Avoid use of XELJANZ during an active serious infection, including localized infections. (  5.1  ) \n *  Gastrointestinal Perforations - Use with caution in patients that may be at increased risk. (  5.3  ) \n *  Laboratory Monitoring -Recommended due to potential changes in lymphocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, liver enzymes and lipids. (  5.4  ) \n *  Immunizations - Live vaccines: Avoid use with XELJANZ. (  5.5  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Serious Infections\n\n\n\n   Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving XELJANZ. The most common serious infections reported with XELJANZ included pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, urinary tract infection, and diverticulitis [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections, cryptococcosis, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus were reported with XELJANZ. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease, and were often taking concomitant immunomodulating agents such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.  \n\n\n\n Other serious infections that were not reported in clinical studies may also occur (e.g., histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and listeriosis).\n\n\n\n Avoid use of XELJANZ in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating XELJANZ in patients:\n\n\n\n *  with chronic or recurrent infection \n *  who have been exposed to tuberculosis \n *  with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection \n *  who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or \n *  with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. \n    Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with XELJANZ. XELJANZ should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with XELJANZ should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient; appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the patient should be closely monitored.\n \n\n    Tuberculosis  \n\n\n\n Patients should be evaluated and tested for latent or active infection prior to administration of XELJANZ.\n\n\n\n Anti-tuberculosis therapy should also be considered prior to administration of XELJANZ in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but who have risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision about whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.\n\n\n\n Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, including patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy.\n\n\n\n Patients with latent tuberculosis should be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy before administering XELJANZ.\n\n\n\n    Viral Reactivation  \n\n\n\n  Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ. The impact of XELJANZ on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Patients who screened positive for hepatitis B or C were excluded from clinical trials. Screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy with XELJANZ. The risk of herpes zoster is increased in patients treated with XELJANZ and appears to be higher in patients treated with XELJANZ in Japan.  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders\n\n\n\n  Consider the risks and benefits of XELJANZ treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing XELJANZ in patients who develop a malignancy. Malignancies were observed in clinical studies of XELJANZ [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n In the seven controlled rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies, 11 solid cancers and one lymphoma were diagnosed in 3328 patients receiving XELJANZ with or without DMARD, compared to 0 solid cancers and 0 lymphomas in 809 patients in the placebo with or without DMARD group during the first 12 months of exposure. Lymphomas and solid cancers have also been observed in the long-term extension studies in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with XELJANZ.\n\n\n\n In Phase 2B, controlled dose-ranging trials in de-novo  renal transplant patients, all of whom received induction therapy with basiliximab, high-dose corticosteroids, and mycophenolic acid products, Epstein Barr Virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder was observed in 5 out of 218 patients treated with XELJANZ (2.3%) compared to 0 out of 111 patients treated with cyclosporine.\n\n\n\n    Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer  \n\n\n\n Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) have been reported in patients treated with XELJANZ. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Gastrointestinal Perforations\n\n\n\n  Events of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in clinical studies with XELJANZ in rheumatoid arthritis patients, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known.\n\n\n\n XELJANZ should be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptoms should be evaluated promptly for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Laboratory Abnormalities\n\n\n\n   Lymphocyte Abnormalities  \n\n\n\n Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with initial lymphocytosis at one month of exposure followed by a gradual decrease in mean absolute lymphocyte counts below the baseline of approximately 10% during 12 months of therapy. Lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells/mm  3  were associated with an increased incidence of treated and serious infections.\n\n\n\n Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with a low lymphocyte count (i.e., less than 500 cells/mm  3  ). In patients who develop a confirmed absolute lymphocyte count less than 500 cells/mm  3  treatment with XELJANZ is not recommended.\n\n\n\n Monitor lymphocyte counts at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on lymphocyte counts see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    .\n\n\n\n    Neutropenia  \n\n\n\n Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (less than 2000 cells/mm  3  ) compared to placebo.\n\n\n\n Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with a low neutrophil count (i.e., ANC less than 1000 cells/mm  3  ). For patients who develop a persistent ANC of 500-1000 cells/mm  3  , interrupt XELJANZ dosing until ANC is greater than or equal to 1000 cells/mm  3  . In patients who develop an ANC less than 500 cells/mm  3  , treatment with XELJANZ is not recommended.\n\n\n\n Monitor neutrophil counts at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on ANC results see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    .\n\n\n\n    Anemia  \n\n\n\n Avoid initiation of XELJANZ treatment in patients with a low hemoglobin level (i.e. less than 9 g/dL). Treatment with XELJANZ should be interrupted in patients who develop hemoglobin levels less than 8 g/dL or whose hemoglobin level drops greater than 2 g/dL on treatment.\n\n\n\n Monitor hemoglobin at baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on hemoglobin results see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    .\n\n\n\n    Liver Enzyme Elevations  \n\n\n\n Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Most of these abnormalities occurred in studies with background DMARD (primarily methotrexate) therapy.\n\n\n\n Routine monitoring of liver tests and prompt investigation of the causes of liver enzyme elevations is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If drug-induced liver injury is suspected, the administration of XELJANZ should be interrupted until this diagnosis has been excluded.\n\n\n\n    Lipid Elevations  \n\n\n\n Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with increases in lipid parameters including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Maximum effects were generally observed within 6 weeks. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.\n\n\n\n Assessment of lipid parameters should be performed approximately 4-8 weeks following initiation of XELJANZ therapy.\n\n\n\n Manage patients according to clinical guidelines [e.g., National Cholesterol Educational Program (NCEP)] for the management of hyperlipidemia.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Vaccinations\n\n\n\n  No data are available on the response to vaccination or on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines to patients receiving XELJANZ. Avoid use of live vaccines concurrently with XELJANZ.\n\n\n\n Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating XELJANZ therapy.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Neoplastic growth. There is a risk for acceleration of neoplastic growth. Colonoscopy of the entire colon with removal of polyps should be done before initiating treatment with GATTEX and is recommended after 1 year. Subsequent colonoscopies should be done as needed, but no less frequently than every 5 years. In case of intestinal malignancy discontinue GATTEX. The clinical decision to continue GATTEX in patients with non-gastrointestinal malignancy should be made based on risk and benefit considerations. (  5.1  ) \n *  Intestinal obstruction. In patients who develop obstruction, GATTEX should be temporarily discontinued pending further clinical evaluation and management. (  5.2  ) \n *  Biliary and pancreatic disease. Patients should undergo laboratory assessment (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lipase, amylase) before starting GATTEX. Subsequent laboratory tests should be done every 6 months. If clinically meaningful changes are seen, further evaluation is recommended including imaging, and continued treatment with GATTEX should be reassessed. (  5.3  ) \n *  Fluid overload. There is a potential for fluid overload while on GATTEX. If fluid overload occurs, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease, parenteral support should be appropriately adjusted, and GATTEX treatment reassessed. (  5.4  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Acceleration of Neoplastic Growth\n\n\n\n  Based on the pharmacologic activity and findings in animals, GATTEX has the potential to cause hyperplastic changes including neoplasia. In patients at increased risk for malignancy, the clinical decision to use GATTEX should be considered only if the benefits outweigh the risks. In patients with active gastrointestinal malignancy (GI tract, hepatobiliary, pancreatic), GATTEX therapy should be discontinued. In patients with active non-gastrointestinal malignancy, the clinical decision to continue GATTEX should be made based on risk-benefit considerations. [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  and  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  \n\n\n\n    Colorectal Polyps  \n\n\n\n Colorectal polyps were identified during the clinical trials. Colonoscopy of the entire colon with removal of polyps should be done within 6 months prior to starting treatment with GATTEX. A follow-up colonoscopy (or alternate imaging) is recommended at the end of 1 year of GATTEX. Subsequent colonoscopies should be done every 5 years or more often as needed. If a polyp is found, adherence to current polyp follow-up guidelines is recommended. In case of diagnosis of colorectal cancer, GATTEX therapy should be discontinued . [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  \n\n\n\n    Small Bowel Neoplasia  \n\n\n\n Based on benign tumor findings in the rat carcinogenicity study, patients should be monitored clinically for small bowel neoplasia. If a benign neoplasm is found, it should be removed. In case of small bowel cancer, GATTEX therapy should be discontinued. [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Intestinal Obstruction\n\n\n\n  Intestinal obstruction has been reported in clinical trials. In patients who develop intestinal or stomal obstruction, GATTEX should be temporarily discontinued while the patient is clinically managed. GATTEX may be restarted when the obstructive presentation resolves, if clinically indicated. [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Biliary and Pancreatic Disease\n\n\n\n   Gallbladder and Biliary Tract Disease  \n\n\n\n Cholecystitis, cholangitis, and cholelithiasis, have been reported in clinical studies. For identification of the onset or worsening of gallbladder/biliary disease, patients should undergo laboratory assessment of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase within 6 months prior to starting GATTEX, and at least every 6 months while on GATTEX; or more frequently if needed. If clinically meaningful changes are seen, further evaluation including imaging of the gallbladder and/or biliary tract is recommended; and the need for continued GATTEX treatment should be reassessed. [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  \n\n\n\n    Pancreatic Disease  \n\n\n\n Pancreatitis has been reported in clinical studies. For identification of onset or worsening of pancreatic disease, patients should undergo laboratory assessment of lipase and amylase within 6 months prior to starting GATTEX, and at least every 6 months while on GATTEX; or more frequently if needed. If clinically meaningful changes are seen, further evaluation such as imaging of the pancreas is recommended; and the need for continued GATTEX treatment should be reassessed. [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  and  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)  ]  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Fluid Overload\n\n\n\n  Fluid overload and congestive heart failure have been observed in clinical trials, which were felt to be related to enhanced fluid absorption associated with GATTEX. If fluid overload occurs, parenteral support should be adjusted and GATTEX treatment should be reassessed, especially in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. If significant cardiac deterioration develops while on GATTEX, the need for continued GATTEX treatment should be reassessed. [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  \n\n\n\n    5.5 Increased Absorption of Concomitant Oral Medication\n\n\n\n  Altered mental status in association with GATTEX has been observed in patients on benzodiazepines in clinical trials. Patients on concomitant oral drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines, phenothiazines) requiring titration or with a narrow therapeutic index may require dose adjustment while on GATTEX.

Discontinue Xofigo if hematologic values do not recover within 6 to 8 weeks after treatment. Monitor patients with compromised bone marrow reserve closely. Discontinue Xofigo in patients who experience life-threatening complications despite supportive care measures. (  5.1  )\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n   5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression\n\n\n\n  In the randomized trial, 2% of patients on the Xofigo arm experienced bone marrow failure or ongoing pancytopenia compared to no patients treated with placebo. There were two deaths due to bone marrow failure and for 7 of 13 patients treated with Xofigo, bone marrow failure was ongoing at the time of death. Among the 13 patients who experienced bone marrow failure, 54% required blood transfusions. Four percent (4%) of patients on the Xofigo arm and 2% on the placebo arm permanently discontinued therapy due to bone marrow suppression.\n\n\n\n In the randomized trial, deaths related to vascular hemorrhage in association with myelosuppression were observed in 1% of Xofigo-treated patients compared to 0.3% of patients treated with placebo. The incidence of infection-related deaths (2%), serious infections (10%), and febrile neutropenia (<1%) were similar for patients treated with Xofigo and placebo. Myelosuppression; notably thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, and leukopenia; has been reported in patients treated with Xofigo. In the randomized trial, complete blood counts (CBCs) were obtained every 4 weeks prior to each dose and the nadir CBCs and times of recovery were not well characterized. In a separate single-dose phase 1 study of Xofigo, neutrophil and platelet count nadirs occurred 2 to 3 weeks after Xofigo administration at doses that were up to 1 to 5 times the recommended dose, and most patients recovered approximately 6 to 8 weeks after administration [see Adverse Reactions (  6  )]  .\n\n\n\n Hematologic evaluation of patients must be performed at baseline and prior to every dose of Xofigo. Before the first administration of Xofigo, the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be >= 1.5 x 10  9  /L, the platelet count >= 100 x 10  9  /L and hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL. Before subsequent administrations of Xofigo, the ANC should be >= 1 x 10  9  /L and the platelet count >= 50 x 10  9  /L. If there is no recovery to these values within 6 to 8 weeks after the last administration of Xofigo, despite receiving supportive care, further treatment with Xofigo should be discontinued. Patients with evidence of compromised bone marrow reserve should be monitored closely and provided with supportive care measures when clinically indicated. Discontinue Xofigo in patients who experience life-threatening complications despite supportive care for bone marrow failure.\n\n\n\n The safety and efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy with Xofigo have not been established. Outside of a clinical trial, concomitant use with chemotherapy is not recommended due to the potential for additive myelosuppression. If chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotopes or hemibody external radiotherapy are administered during the treatment period, Xofigo should be discontinued.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Myelosuppression: severe and fatal thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anemia. Monitor hematologic parameters frequently (  2.3  ,  5.1  ). \n *    Bleeding: severe thrombocytopenia and increased risk of hemorrhage. Fatal cerebral hemorrhage and severe, non-fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage (  5.1  ,  5.2  ). \n *    Hyperglycemia: glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia including hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia (  5.3  ). \n *    Embryo-fetal toxicity: can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid pregnancy (  5.4  ,  8.1  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Myelosuppression\n\n\n\n  In uncontrolled trials with SYNRIBO, patients with chronic phase and accelerated phase CML experienced NCI CTC (version 3.0) Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (85%, 88%), neutropenia (81%, 71%), and anemia (62%, 80%), respectively. Fatalities related to myelosuppression occurred in 3% of patients in the safety population (N=163). Patients with neutropenia are at increased risk for infections, and should be monitored frequently and advised to contact a physician if they have symptoms of infection or fever.\n\n\n\n Monitor complete blood counts weekly during induction and initial maintenance cycles and every two weeks during later maintenance cycles, as clinically indicated. In clinical trials myelosuppression was generally reversible and usually managed by delaying next cycle and/or reducing days of treatment with SYNRIBO [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  ) and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Bleeding\n\n\n\n  SYNRIBO causes severe thrombocytopenia which increases the risk of hemorrhage. In clinical trials with CP and AP CML patients, a high incidence of Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia (85% and 88%, respectively) was observed. Fatalities from cerebral hemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients treated with SYNRIBO in the safety population. Severe, non-fatal, gastrointestinal hemorrhages occurred in 2% of patients in the same population. Most bleeding events were associated with severe thrombocytopenia.\n\n\n\n Monitor platelet counts as part of the CBC monitoring as recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )].  Avoid anticoagulants, aspirin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) when the platelet count is less than 50,000/uL as they may increase the risk of bleeding.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Hyperglycemia\n\n\n\n  SYNRIBO can induce glucose intolerance. Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia was reported in 11% of patients in the safety population. Hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia occurred in 1 patient treated with SYNRIBO in the safety population. Monitor blood glucose levels frequently, especially in patients with diabetes or risk factors for diabetes. Avoid SYNRIBO in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus until good glycemic control has been established.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  SYNRIBO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate caused embryo-fetal death in animals. Females of reproductive potential should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with SYNRIBO. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of SYNRIBO in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )].  \n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Hypertension: Monitor for high blood pressure and manage as clinically indicated (  5.4  ). \n *  Pancreatitis: Monitor serum lipase monthly; interrupt or discontinue Iclusig (  2.3  ,  5.5  ). \n *  Neuropathy: Monitor for symptoms of peripheral and cranial neuropathy (  5.6  ). \n *  Ocular Toxicity: Conduct comprehensive eye exams at baseline and periodically during treatment (  5.7  ). \n *  Hemorrhage: Interrupt Iclusig for serious or severe hemorrhage (  5.8  ). \n *  Fluid Retention: Monitor patients for fluid retention; interrupt, reduce, or discontinue Iclusig (  5.9  ). \n *  Cardiac Arrhythmias: Monitor for symptoms of arrhythmias (  5.10  ,  6  ). \n *  Myelosuppression: Thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia may require dose interruption or reduction. Monitor complete blood counts every 2 weeks for 3 months and then monthly and as clinically indicated. Interrupt Iclusig for ANC < 1000/mm  3  or thrombocytopenia < 50,000/ mm  3  (  2.2  ,  5.11  ). \n *  Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Ensure adequate hydration and correct elevated uric acid levels prior to initiating therapy with Iclusig (  5.12  ). \n *  Compromised Wound Healing and Gastrointestinal Perforation: Temporarily interrupt therapy in patients undergoing major surgical procedures (  5.13  ). \n *  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to a fetus (  5.14  ,  8.1  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Vascular Occlusion\n\n\n\n   Arterial and venous thrombosis and occlusions, including fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, stenosis of large arterial vessels of the brain, severe peripheral vascular disease, and the need for urgent revascularization procedures have occurred in at least 27% of Iclusig-treated patients from the phase 1 and phase 2 trials. Iclusig can cause fatal and life-threatening vascular occlusion within 2 weeks of starting treatment. Iclusig can also cause recurrent or multi-site vascular occlusion.  \n\n\n\n  In the dose-escalation (phase 1) clinical trial, 48% (31/65) of patients with CML or Ph+ ALL developed vascular occlusive events. The median time to onset of the first vascular occlusion event was 5 months. Iclusig can cause fatal and life-threatening vascular occlusion in patients treated at dose levels as low as 15 mg per day.  \n\n\n\n  Patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors, including patients age 50 years or younger, experienced these events. Vascular occlusion adverse events were more frequent with increasing age and in patients with prior history of ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia (see  Table 4  ).  \n\n\n\n Table 4: Vascular Occlusion Incidence in Iclusig-Treated Patients in Phase 2 Trial According to Risk Categories \n                        Prior history of ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia    No history of ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia   \n  \n  Age: 49 or younger                   18%(6/33)                                12%(13/112)                  \n  Age: 50 to 74 years                  33%(50/152)                               18%(20/114)                  \n  Age: 75 and older                   56%(14/25)                                46%(6/13)                   \n  All age groups                     33%(70/210)                               16%(39/239)                  \n  Total                              24%(109/449)                 \n             Arterial Occlusion and Thrombosis    \n \n\n  Arterial occlusion and thrombosis occurred in at least 20% (91/449) of Iclusig-treated patients with some patients experiencing events of more than one type. Patients have required revascularization procedures (cerebrovascular, coronary, and peripheral arterial) due to vascular occlusion from Iclusig.  \n\n\n\n  Cardiac vascular occlusion, including fatal and life-threatening myocardial infarction and coronary artery occlusion has occurred in 12% (55/449) of Iclusig-treated patients. Patients have developed heart failure concurrent or subsequent to the myocardial ischemic event.  \n\n\n\n  Cerebrovascular occlusion, including fatal stroke, has occurred in 6% (27/449) of Iclusig-treated patients. Iclusig can cause stenosis over multiple segments in major arterial vessels that supply the brain (e.g., carotid, vertebral, middle cerebral artery).  \n\n\n\n  Peripheral arterial occlusive events, including fatal mesenteric artery occlusion and life-threatening peripheral arterial disease, have occurred in 8% (36/449) of Iclusig-treated patients. Patients have developed digital or distal extremity necrosis and have required amputations.  \n\n\n\n  Clinicians should consider whether the benefits of Iclusig treatment are expected to exceed the risks of therapy. In patients suspected of developing arterial thrombotic events, interrupt or stop Iclusig. A benefit-risk consideration should guide a decision to restart Iclusig therapy. [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n     Venous Thromboembolism    \n\n\n\n  Venous thromboembolic events occurred in 5% (23/449) of Iclusig-treated patients, including deep venous thrombosis (8 patients), pulmonary embolism (6 patients), superficial thrombophlebitis (3 patients), and retinal vein thrombosis (2 patients). Consider dose modification or discontinuation of Iclusig in patients who develop serious venous thromboembolism [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Heart Failure\n\n\n\n   Fatal and serious heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 5% of Iclusig-treated patients (N =22). Eight percent of patients (N= 35) experienced any grade of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms consistent with heart failure and treat as clinically indicated, including interruption of Iclusig. Consider discontinuation of Iclusig in patients who develop serious heart failure [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Hepatotoxicity\n\n\n\n  Iclusig can cause hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Fulminant hepatic failure leading to death occurred in an Iclusig-treated patient within one week of starting Iclusig. Two additional fatal cases of acute liver failure also occurred. The fatal cases occurred in patients with blast phase (BP) CML or Ph+ ALL. Severe hepatotoxicity occurred in all disease cohorts.\n\n\n\n The incidence of aspartate aminotransferase (ALT) or alanine aminotransferase (AST) elevation was 56% (all grades) and 8% (grade 3 or 4). Iclusig treatment may result in elevation in ALT, AST, or both. ALT or AST elevation was not reversed by the date of last follow-up in 5% of patients.\n\n\n\n Monitor liver function tests at baseline, then at least monthly or as clinically indicated. Interrupt, reduce or discontinue Iclusig as clinically indicated [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4 Hypertension\n\n\n\n   Treatment-emergent hypertension occurred in 67% of patients (300/449). Eight patients (2%) treated with Iclusig in clinical trials experienced treatment-emergent symptomatic hypertension as a serious adverse reaction, including hypertensive crisis. Patients may require urgent clinical intervention for hypertension associated with confusion, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  . In patients with baseline systolic BP<140 mm Hg and baseline diastolic BP<90mm Hg, 78% (220/282) experienced treatment-emergent hypertension; 49% (139/282) developed Stage 1 hypertension (defined as systolic BP>=140 mm Hg or diastolic BP>=90 mm Hg) while 29% developed Stage 2 hypertension (defined as systolic BP>=160 mm Hg or diastolic BP>=100 mm Hg). In 131 patients with Stage 1 hypertension at baseline, 61% (80/131) developed Stage 2 hypertension. Monitor and manage blood pressure elevations during Iclusig use and treat hypertension to normalize blood pressure. Interrupt, dose reduce, or stop Iclusig if hypertension is not medically controlled.  \n\n\n\n    5.5 Pancreatitis\n\n\n\n  Clinical pancreatitis occurred in 6% (28/449) of patients (5% grade 3) treated with Iclusig. Pancreatitis resulted in discontinuation or treatment interruption in 6% of patients (25/449). Twenty-two of the 28 cases of pancreatitis resolved within 2 weeks with dose interruption or reduction. The incidence of treatment-emergent lipase elevation was 41%.\n\n\n\n Check serum lipase every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter or as clinically indicated. Consider additional serum lipase monitoring in patients with a history of pancreatitis or alcohol abuse. Dose interruption or reduction may be required. In cases where lipase elevations are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, interrupt treatment with Iclusig and evaluate patients for pancreatitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  Do not consider restarting Iclusig until patients have complete resolution of symptoms and lipase levels are less than 1.5 * ULN.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Neuropathy\n\n\n\n   Peripheral and cranial neuropathy have occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. Overall, 13% (59/449) of Iclusig-treated patients experienced a peripheral neuropathy event of any grade (2%, grade 3/4). In clinical trials, the most common peripheral neuropathies reported were peripheral neuropathy (4%, 18/449), paresthesia (4%, 17/449), hypoesthesia (2%, 11/449), and hyperesthesia (1%, 5/449). Cranial neuropathy developed in 1% (6/449) of Iclusig-treated patients (<1% grade 3/4).  \n\n\n\n  Of the patients who developed neuropathy, 31% (20/65) developed neuropathy during the first month of treatment. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain or weakness. Consider interrupting Iclusig and evaluate if neuropathy is suspected.  \n\n\n\n    5.7 Ocular Toxicity\n\n\n\n   Serious ocular toxicities leading to blindness or blurred vision have occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. Retinal toxicities including macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal hemorrhage occurred in 3% of Iclusig-treated patients. Conjunctival or corneal irritation, dry eye, or eye pain occurred in 13% of patients. Visual blurring occurred in 6% of patients. Other ocular toxicities include cataracts, glaucoma, iritis, iridocyclitis, and ulcerative keratitis. Conduct comprehensive eye exams at baseline and periodically during treatment [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.8 Hemorrhage\n\n\n\n  Serious bleeding events, including fatalities, occurred in 5% (22/449) of patients treated with Iclusig. Hemorrhage occurred in 24% of patients. The incidence of serious bleeding events was higher in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL. Cerebral hemorrhage and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were the most commonly reported serious bleeding events. Most hemorrhagic events, but not all, occurred in patients with grade 4 thrombocytopenia [   see  Warnings and Precautions (5.11)  ]  . Interrupt Iclusig for serious or severe hemorrhage and evaluate [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.9 Fluid Retention\n\n\n\n  Fluid retention events judged as serious occurred in 3% (13/449) of patients treated with Iclusig. One instance of brain edema was fatal. Serious fluid retention events in more than 1 patient included: pericardial effusion (6/449, 1%), pleural effusion (5/449, 1%), and ascites (2/449, <1%).\n\n\n\n In total, fluid retention occurred in 23% of the patients. The most common fluid retention events were peripheral edema (16%), pleural effusion (7%), and pericardial effusion (3%).\n\n\n\n Monitor patients for fluid retention and manage patients as clinically indicated. Interrupt, reduce, or discontinue Iclusig as clinically indicated [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.10 Cardiac Arrhythmias\n\n\n\n  Symptomatic bradyarrhythmias that led to a requirement for pacemaker implantation occurred in 1% (3/449) of Iclusig-treated patients. The cardiac rhythms (1 case each) identified were complete heart block, sick sinus syndrome, and atrial fibrillation with bradycardia and pauses. Advise patients to report signs and symptoms suggestive of slow heart rate (fainting, dizziness, or chest pain). Interrupt Iclusig and evaluate.\n\n\n\n Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred in 5% (25/449) of Iclusig-treated patients. Atrial fibrillation was the most common supraventricular tachyarrhythmia and occurred in 20 patients. The other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias were atrial flutter (4 patients), supraventricular tachycardia (4 patients), and atrial tachycardia (1 patient). For 13 patients, the event led to hospitalization. Advise patients to report signs and symptoms of rapid heart rate (palpitations, dizziness). Interrupt Iclusig and evaluate.\n\n\n\n    5.11 Myelosuppression\n\n\n\n  Severe (grade 3 or 4) myelosuppression occurred in 48% (215/449) of patients treated with Iclusig. The incidence of these events was greater in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ALL than in patients with CP-CML. Obtain complete blood counts every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and then monthly or as clinically indicated, and adjust the dose as recommended [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.12 Tumor Lysis Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Two patients (<1%) treated with Iclusig developed serious tumor lysis syndrome. Both cases occurred in patients with advanced CML. Hyperuricemia occurred in 7% (30/449) of patients; the majority had CP-CML (19 patients). Due to the potential for tumor lysis syndrome in patients with advanced disease (AP-CML, BP-CML, or Ph+ ALL), ensure adequate hydration and treat high uric acid levels prior to initiating therapy with Iclusig.\n\n\n\n    5.13 Compromised Wound Healing and Gastrointestinal Perforation\n\n\n\n  No formal studies of the effect of Iclusig on wound healing have been conducted. Based on the mechanism of action [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)  ]  , Iclusig could compromise wound healing. Serious gastrointestinal perforation (fistula) occurred in one patient 38 days post-cholecystectomy.\n\n\n\n Interrupt Iclusig for at least 1 week prior to major surgery. The decision when to resume Iclusig after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing.\n\n\n\n    5.14 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Iclusig can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals. Ponatinib caused embryo-fetal toxicity in rats at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended human dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Advise women to avoid pregnancy while taking Iclusig [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .\n",

        "section_text": "     5        WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Permanent vision loss: Baseline and periodic vision assessment is required (  5.1  ) \n *  Abnormal MRI signal changes have been reported in some infants with IS receiving SABRIL (  5.3  ) \n *  Suicidal behavior and ideation: Antiepileptic drugs, including SABRIL increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior (  5.5  ) \n *  Withdrawal of AEDs: Dose should be tapered gradually to avoid withdrawal seizures (  5.6  ) \n *  Anemia: Monitor for symptoms of anemia (  5.7  ) \n *  Somnolence and fatigue: Advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on SABRIL (  5.8  ) \n    \n \n\n    5.1        Vision Loss  \n\n\n\n   Because of the risk of vision loss, and because, when it is effective, SABRIL provides an observable symptomatic benefit, patient response and continued need for treatment should be periodically assessed.  \n\n\n\n  In patients with refractory complex partial seizures, SABRIL should be withdrawn if a substantial clinical benefit is not observed within 3 months of initiating treatment. If, in the clinical judgment of the prescriber, evidence of treatment failure becomes obvious earlier than 3 months, treatment should be discontinued at that time.  \n\n\n\n  In patients with infantile spasms, SABRIL should be withdrawn if a substantial clinical benefit is not observed within 2 to 4 weeks. If, in the clinical judgment of the prescriber, evidence of treatment failure becomes obvious earlier than 2 to 4 weeks, treatment should be discontinued at that time [see  BOXED WARNING  ].    \n\n\n\n   Monitoring of Vision    \n\n\n\n Monitoring of vision by an ophthalmic professional with expertise in visual field interpretation and the ability to perform dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy of the retina is required, unless a patient is formally exempted from periodic ophthalmologic assessment as documented in the Support, Help And Resources for Epilepsy (SHARE) program [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].  Because vision testing in infants is difficult, vision loss may not be detected until it is severe. For patients receiving SABRIL who are not exempted, vision assessment is required at baseline (no later than 4 weeks after starting SABRIL) and at least every 3 months while on therapy and about 3-6 months after the discontinuation of therapy.\n\n\n\n  The diagnostic approach should be individualized for the patient and clinical situation.  For all patients, attempts to monitor vision periodically and/or formal exemptions must be documented under the SHARE program.  In adults and cooperative pediatric patients, perimetry is recommended, preferably by automated threshold visual field testing.  Additional testing may also include electrophysiology (e.g., electroretinography [ERG]), retinal imaging (e.g., optical coherence tomography [OCT]), and/or other methods appropriate for the patient, but this additional testing is not required. In patients exempted from vision testing, treatment may continue according to clinical judgment, with appropriate patient counseling and with documentation in the SHARE program of the exemption.  Because of variability, results from ophthalmic monitoring must be interpreted with caution, and repeat assessment is recommended if results are abnormal or uninterpretable.  Repeat assessment in the first few weeks of treatment is recommended to establish if, and to what degree, reproducible results can be obtained, and to guide selection of appropriate ongoing monitoring for the patient.\n\n\n\n The onset and progression of vision loss from SABRIL is unpredictable, and it may occur or worsen precipitously between assessments.  Once detected, vision loss due to SABRIL is not reversible. It is expected that even with frequent monitoring, some SABRIL patients will develop severe vision loss. Drug discontinuation should be considered, balancing benefit and risk, if visual loss is documented.\n\n\n\n     5.2        SABRIL SHARE Program  \n\n\n\n  SABRIL is available only through a restricted distribution program called the SHARE program, because of the risk of vision loss.\n\n\n\n Notable requirements components of the SHARE Program include the following:\n\n\n\n *  *  Assess vision prior to initiating therapy and then every 3 months during therapy. \n *  Remove patients from SABRIL therapy if the patients do not experience a meaningful reduction in seizures. \n *  *  The patient is blind (subsequent Ophthalmologic Assessment Forms do not need to be submitted to the REMS coordinating center) \n *  The patient's general neurological and/or mental condition permanently precludes the need for visual assessment (subsequent Ophthalmologic Assessment Forms do not need to be submitted to the REMS coordinating center) \n *  The patient's general neurological condition temporarily precludes the ability to assess visual function.  The evaluation, however, may be performed at a later time as clinically appropriate. \n *  The patient's medical condition prevents visual assessment being performed safely \n *  For other reasons specified by the prescriber \n   The prescriber may, with appropriate documentation and caregiver counseling, exempt certain patients from vision assessment, using the Ophthalmologic Assessment Form, if: \n   Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and reviewing educational materials and comply with the following: \n *  Patient/parent/legal guardian must understand the risks and benefits and sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement. \n *  Pharmacies that dispense SABRIL must be certified and agree to comply with the REMS requirements.   Certified pharmacies must only dispense SABRIL to patients who are enrolled in the program. \n        5.3        Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Abnormalities in Infants  \n \n\n  Abnormal MRI signal changes characterized by increased T2 signal and restricted diffusion in a symmetric pattern involving the thalamus, basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum have been observed in some infants treated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms. In a retrospective epidemiologic study in infants with IS (N=205), the prevalence of these changes was 22% in vigabatrin treated patients versus 4% in patients treated with other therapies. \n\n\n\n In the study above, in post marketing experience, and in published literature reports, these changes generally resolved with discontinuation of treatment. In a few patients, the lesion resolved despite continued use.  It has been reported that some infants exhibited coincident motor abnormalities, but no causal relationship has been established and the potential for long-term clinical sequelae has not been adequately studied.\n\n\n\n Neurotoxicity (brain histopathology and neurobehavioral abnormalities) was observed in rats exposed to vigabatrin during late gestation and the neonatal and juvenile periods of development.  The relationship between these findings and the abnormal MRI findings in infants treated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms is unknown [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.4)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n The specific pattern of signal changes observed in IS patients was not observed in older pediatric and adult patients treated with vigabatrin for refractory CPS. In a blinded review of MRI images obtained in prospective clinical trials in patients with refractory CPS 3 years and older (N=656), no difference was observed in anatomic distribution or prevalence of MRI signal changes between vigabatrin treated and placebo treated patients.\n\n\n\n For adults treated with SABRIL, routine MRI surveillance is unnecessary as there is no evidence that vigabatrin causes MRI changes in this population.\n\n\n\n     5.4        Neurotoxicity  \n\n\n\n  Vacuolation, characterized by fluid accumulation and separation of the outer layers of myelin, has been observed in brain white matter tracts in adult and juvenile rats and adult mice, dogs, and possibly monkeys following administration of vigabatrin. This lesion, referred to as intramyelinic edema (IME), was seen in animals at doses within the human therapeutic range. A no-effect dose was not established in rodents or dogs. In the rat and dog, vacuolation was reversible following discontinuation of vigabatrin treatment, but, in the rat, pathologic changes consisting of swollen or degenerating axons, mineralization, and gliosis were seen in brain areas in which vacuolation had been previously observed.  Vacuolation in adult animals was correlated with alterations in MRI and changes in visual and somatosensory evoked potentials (EP).\n\n\n\n Administration of vigabatrin to rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of development produced vacuolar changes in the brain gray matter (areas including the thalamus, midbrain, deep cerebellar nuclei, substantia nigra, hippocampus, and forebrain) which are considered distinct from the IME observed in vigabatrin treated adult animals. Decreased myelination and evidence of oligodendrocyte injury were additional findings in the brains of vigabatrin-treated rats.  An increase in apoptosis was seen in some brain regions following vigabatrin exposure during the early postnatal period.   Long-term neurobehavioral abnormalities (convulsions, neuromotor impairment, learning deficits) were also observed following vigabatrin treatment of young rats. These effects in young animals occurred at doses lower than those producing neurotoxicity in adult animals and were associated with plasma vigabatrin levels substantially lower than those achieved clinically in infants and children [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n In a published study, vigabatrin (200, 400 mg/kg/day) induced apoptotic neurodegeneration in the brain of young rats when administered by intraperitoneal injection on postnatal days 5-7.\n\n\n\n Administration of vigabatrin to female rats during pregnancy and lactation at doses below those used clinically resulted in hippocampal vacuolation and convulsions in the mature offspring.\n\n\n\n Abnormal MRI signal changes characterized by increased T2 signal and restricted diffusion in a symmetric pattern involving the thalamus, basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum have been observed in some infants treated for IS with vigabatrin.  Studies of the effects of vigabatrin on MRI and EP in adult epilepsy patients have demonstrated no clear-cut abnormalities [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n     5.5        Suicidal Behavior and Ideation  \n\n\n\n  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including SABRIL, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.\n\n\n\n Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug treated patients in the trials and none in placebo treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\n\n\n\n The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.\n\n\n\n The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 4 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.\n\n\n\n Table 4. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis \n   Indication       Placebo Patients with Events per 1000 Patients    Drug Patients with Events per 1000 Patients     Relative Risk: Incidence of Drug Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients      Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events per 1000 Patients    \n  Epilepsy         1.0              3.4              3.5              2.4              \n  Psychiatric      5.7              8.5              1.5              2.9              \n  Other            1.0              1.8              1.9              0.9              \n  Total            2.4              4.3              1.8              1.9              \n           The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.\n \n\n Anyone considering prescribing SABRIL or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.\n\n\n\n Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.\n\n\n\n     5.6        Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs)  \n\n\n\n  As with all AEDs, SABRIL should be withdrawn gradually. Patients and caregivers should be told not to suddenly discontinue SABRIL therapy.\n\n\n\n In controlled clinical studies in adults with complex partial seizures, SABRIL was tapered by decreasing the daily dose 1000 mg/day on a weekly basis until discontinued.\n\n\n\n In a controlled study in pediatric patients with complex partial seizures, SABRIL was tapered by decreasing the daily dose by one third every week for three weeks.\n\n\n\n In a controlled clinical study in patients with infantile spasms, SABRIL was tapered by decreasing the daily dose at a rate of 25-50 mg/kg every 3-4 days [see  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n     5.7        Anemia  \n\n\n\n  In North American controlled trials in adults, 6% of patients (16/280) receiving SABRIL and 2% of patients (3/188) receiving placebo had adverse events of anemia and/or met criteria for potentially clinically important hematology changes involving hemoglobin, hematocrit, and/or RBC indices.  Across U.S. controlled trials, there were mean decreases in hemoglobin of about 3% and 0% in SABRIL and placebo treated patients, respectively, and a mean decrease in hematocrit of about 1% in SABRIL treated patients compared to a mean gain of about 1% in patients treated with placebo.\n\n\n\n In controlled and open label epilepsy trials in adults and pediatric patients, 3 SABRIL patients (0.06%, 3/4855) discontinued for anemia and 2 SABRIL patients experienced unexplained declines in hemoglobin to below 8 g/dL and/or hematocrit below 24%.\n\n\n\n     5.8        Somnolence and Fatigue  \n\n\n\n  SABRIL causes somnolence and fatigue. Patients should be advised not to drive a car or operate other complex machinery until they are familiar with the effects of SABRIL on their ability to perform such activities.\n\n\n\n Pooled data from two SABRIL controlled trials in adults demonstrated that 24% (54/222) of SABRIL patients experienced somnolence compared to 10% (14/135) of placebo patients. In those same studies, 28% of SABRIL patients experienced fatigue compared to 15% (20/135) of placebo patients. Almost 1% of SABRIL patients discontinued from clinical trials for somnolence and almost 1% discontinued for fatigue.\n\n\n\n  Pooled data from three SABRIL controlled trials in pediatric patients demonstrated that 6% (10/165) of SABRIL patients experienced somnolence compared to 5% (5/104) of placebo patients. In those same studies, 10% (17/165) of SABRIL patients experienced fatigue compared to 7% (7/104) of placebo patients. No SABRIL patients discontinued from clinical trials due to somnolence or fatigue.  \n\n\n\n     5.9        Peripheral Neuropathy  \n\n\n\n  SABRIL causes symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in adults. Pediatric clinical trials were not designed to assess symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, but observed incidence of symptoms based on pooled data from controlled pediatric studies appeared similar for pediatric patients on vigabatrin and placebo. In a pool of North American controlled and uncontrolled epilepsy studies, 4.2% (19/457) of SABRIL patients developed signs and/or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. In the subset of North American placebo-controlled epilepsy trials, 1.4% (4/280) of SABRIL treated patients and no (0/188) placebo patients developed signs and/or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Initial manifestations of peripheral neuropathy in these trials included, in some combination, symptoms of numbness or tingling in the toes or feet, signs of reduced distal lower limb vibration or position sensation, or progressive loss of reflexes, starting at the ankles. Clinical studies in the development program were not designed to investigate peripheral neuropathy systematically and did not include nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing, or skin or nerve biopsy. There is insufficient evidence to determine if development of these signs and symptoms were related to duration of SABRIL treatment, cumulative dose, or if the findings of peripheral neuropathy were completely reversible upon discontinuation of SABRIL.\n\n\n\n     5.10        Weight Gain  \n\n\n\n  SABRIL causes weight gain in adult and pediatric patients.\n\n\n\n Data pooled from randomized controlled trials in adults found that 17% (77/443) of SABRIL patients versus 8% (22/275) of placebo patients gained >=7% of baseline body weight. In these same trials, the mean weight change among SABRIL patients was 3.5 kg compared to 1.6 kg for placebo patients.\n\n\n\n  Data pooled from randomized controlled trials in pediatric patients with refractory complex partial seizures found that 47% (77/163) of SABRIL patients versus 19% (19/102) of placebo patients gained >=7% of baseline body weight.  \n\n\n\n  In all epilepsy trials, 0.6% (31/4855) of SABRIL patients discontinued for weight gain. The long term effects of SABRIL related weight gain are not known. Weight gain was not related to the occurrence of edema.  \n\n\n\n     5.11        Edema  \n\n\n\n  SABRIL causes edema in adults.  Pediatric clinical trials were not designed to assess edema, but observed incidence of edema based pooled data from controlled pediatric studies appeared similar for pediatric patients on vigabatrin and placebo.\n\n\n\n Pooled data from controlled trials demonstrated increased risk among SABRIL patients compared to placebo patients for peripheral edema (SABRIL 2%, placebo 1%), and edema (SABRIL 1%, placebo 0%). In these studies, one SABRIL and no placebo patients discontinued for an edema related AE. In adults, there was no apparent association between edema and cardiovascular adverse events such as hypertension or congestive heart failure. Edema was not associated with laboratory changes suggestive of deterioration in renal or hepatic function.\n",

Consider pre-treatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids in patients with prior reactions (  5.1  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis\n\n\n\n   Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, occurred in clinical studies and postmarketing experience. [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Hypersensitivity reactions were the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with VPRIV in clinical studies. Patients were not routinely pre-medicated prior to infusion of VPRIV during clinical studies. The most commonly observed symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions were: headache, dizziness, hypotension, hypertension, nausea, fatigue/asthenia, and pyrexia/body temperature increased. Generally the reactions were mild and, in treatment-naive patients, onset occurred mostly during the first 6 months of treatment and tended to occur less frequently with time. Additional hypersensitivity reactions of chest discomfort, dyspnea, and pruritus have been reported in post-marketing experience.  \n\n\n\n As with any intravenous protein product, hypersensitivity reactions are possible, therefore appropriate medical support including personnel adequately trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures and access to emergency measures should be readily available when VPRIV is administered. If anaphylactic or other acute reactions occur, immediately discontinue the infusion of VPRIV and initiate appropriate medical treatment.\n\n\n\n The management of hypersensitivity reactions should be based on the severity of the reaction, e.g., slowing the infusion rate, treatment with medications such as antihistamines, antipyretics and/or corticosteroids, and/or stopping and resuming treatment with increased infusion time. In cases where patients have exhibited symptoms of hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or excipients in the drug product or to other enzyme replacement therapy, pre-treatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may prevent subsequent reactions.\n",

(  5.1  ) \n *    Psychiatric Events including Suicidality: Advise patients, their caregivers, and families to be alert for the emergence or worsening of insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and if such changes occur to contact their healthcare provider. Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with DALIRESP in patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts or behavior. (  5.2  ) \n *    Weight Decrease: Monitor weight regularly. If unexplained or clinically significant weight loss occurs, evaluate weight loss and consider discontinuation of DALIRESP. (  5.3  ) \n *    Drug Interactions: Use with strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is not recommended. (  5.4  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Treatment of Acute Bronchospasm\n\n\n\n  DALIRESP is not a bronchodilator and should not be used for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Psychiatric Events including Suicidality\n\n\n\n  Treatment with DALIRESP is associated with an increase in psychiatric adverse reactions. In 8 controlled clinical trials 5.9% (263) of patients treated with DALIRESP 500 mcg daily reported psychiatric adverse reactions compared to 3.3% (137) treated with placebo. The most commonly reported psychiatric adverse reactions were insomnia, anxiety, and depression which were reported at higher rates in those treated with DALIRESP 500 mcg daily (2.4%, 1.4%, and 1.2% for DALIRESP versus 1.0%, 0.9%, and 0.9% for placebo, respectively) [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Instances of suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have been observed in clinical trials. Three patients experienced suicide-related adverse reactions (one completed suicide and two suicide attempts) while receiving DALIRESP compared to one patient (suicidal ideation) who received placebo. Cases of suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have been observed in the post-marketing setting in patients with or without a history of depression.\n\n\n\n Before using DALIRESP in patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts or behavior, prescribers should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with DALIRESP in such patients. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and if such changes occur to contact their healthcare provider. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with DALIRESP if such events occur.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Weight Decrease\n\n\n\n  Weight loss was a common adverse reaction in DALIRESP clinical trials and was reported in 7.5% (331) of patients treated with DALIRESP 500 mcg once daily compared to 2.1% (89) treated with placebo [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ]. In addition to being reported as adverse reactions, weight was prospectively assessed in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of one year duration. In these studies, 20% of patients receiving roflumilast experienced moderate weight loss (defined as between 5-10% of body weight) compared to 7% of patients who received placebo. In addition, 7% of patients who received roflumilast compared to 2% of patients receiving placebo experienced severe (>10% body weight) weight loss. During follow-up after treatment discontinuation, the majority of patients with weight loss regained some of the weight they had lost while receiving DALIRESP. Patients treated with DALIRESP should have their weight monitored regularly. If unexplained or clinically significant weight loss occurs, weight loss should be evaluated, and discontinuation of DALIRESP should be considered.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Drug Interactions\n\n\n\n  A major step in roflumilast metabolism is the N-oxidation of roflumilast to roflumilast N-oxide by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. The administration of the cytochrome P450 enzyme inducer rifampicin resulted in a reduction in exposure, which may result in a decrease in the therapeutic effectiveness of DALIRESP. Therefore, the use of strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) with DALIRESP is not recommended [ see Drugs That Induce Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes (  7.1  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )  ].\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Infusion reactions: Premedicate patients with glucocorticoid, acetaminophen, and anti-histamine. Monitor patients closely during infusions. Interrupt or discontinue infusion for reactions. (  2.2  ,  5.3  ) \n *  Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Anticipate tumor lysis syndrome; premedicate with anti-hyperuricemics and adequate hydration especially for patients with high tumor burden and/or high circulating lymphocyte count. Correct electrolyte abnormalities, provide supportive care, and monitor renal function and fluid balance. (  5.4  ) \n *  Neutropenia: Monitor for infection. (  5.6  ) \n *  Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet counts and for bleeding. Management of hemorrhage may require blood product support. (  5.7  ) \n *  Immunization: Do not administer live virus vaccines prior to or during GAZYVA treatment. (  5.8  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation\n\n\n\n  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with anti-CD20 antibodies such as GAZYVA. HBV reactivation has been reported in patients who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and also in patients who are HBsAg negative but are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive. Reactivation has also occurred in patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection (i.e., HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive, and hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs] positive).\n\n\n\n HBV reactivation is defined as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level or detection of HBsAg in a person who was previously HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive. Reactivation of HBV replication is often followed by hepatitis, i.e., increase in transaminase levels and, in severe cases, increase in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death.\n\n\n\n Screen all patients for HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating treatment with GAZYVA. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive [regardless of antibody status] or HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive), consult physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for HBV antiviral therapy.\n\n\n\n Monitor patients with evidence of current or prior HBV infection for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis or HBV reactivation during and for several months following treatment with GAZYVA. HBV reactivation has been reported for other CD20-directed cytolytic antibodies following completion of therapy.\n\n\n\n In patients who develop reactivation of HBV while receiving GAZYVA, immediately discontinue GAZYVA and any concomitant chemotherapy and institute appropriate treatment. Resumption of GAZYVA in patients whose HBV reactivation resolves should be discussed with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B. Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of resuming GAZYVA in patients who develop HBV reactivation.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy\n\n\n\n  JC virus infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which can be fatal, was observed in patients treated with GAZYVA. Consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new onset or changes to preexisting neurologic manifestations. Evaluation of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture. Discontinue GAZYVA therapy and consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Infusion Reactions\n\n\n\n  GAZYVA can cause severe and life-threatening infusion reactions. Two thirds of patients experienced a reaction to the first 1000 mg infused of GAZYVA. Infusion reactions can also occur with subsequent infusions. Symptoms may include hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea, and respiratory symptoms (e.g., bronchospasm, larynx and throat irritation, wheezing, laryngeal edema). Other common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertension, flushing, headache, pyrexia, and chills [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Premedicate patients with acetaminophen, antihistamine, and a glucocorticoid .  Institute medical management (e.g., glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, and/or oxygen) for infusion reactions as needed. Closely monitor patients during the entire infusion. Infusion reactions within 24 hours of receiving GAZYVA have occurred [see  Dosage and Administration (2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n For patients with any Grade 4 infusion reactions, including but not limited to anaphylaxis, acute life-threatening respiratory symptoms, or other life-threatening infusion reaction: Stop the GAZYVA infusion. Permanently discontinue GAZYVA therapy.\n\n\n\n For patients with Grade 1, 2, or 3 infusion reactions: Interrupt GAZYVA for Grade 3 reactions until resolution of symptoms. Interrupt or reduce the rate of the infusion for Grade 1 or 2 reactions and manage symptoms [see  Dosage and Administration (2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n  For patients with preexisting cardiac or pulmonary conditions, monitor more frequently throughout the infusion and the post-infusion period since they may be at greater risk of experiencing more severe reactions. Hypotension may occur as part of the GAZYVA infusion reaction. Consider withholding antihypertensive treatments for 12 hours prior to, during each GAZYVA infusion, and for the first hour after administration until blood pressure is stable. For patients at increased risk of hypertensive crisis, consider the benefits versus the risks of withholding their antihypertensive medication as is suggested here.  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and/or hyperphosphatemia from Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) can occur within 12-24 hours after the first infusion. Patients with high tumor burden and/or high circulating lymphocyte count (> 25 * 10  9  /L) are at greater risk for TLS and should receive appropriate tumor lysis prophylaxis with anti-hyperuricemics (e.g., allopurinol) and hydration beginning 12-24 hours prior to the infusion of GAZYVA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].  For treatment of TLS, correct electrolyte abnormalities, monitor renal function and fluid balance, and administer supportive care, including dialysis as indicated.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Infections\n\n\n\n   Serious bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections can occur during and following GAZYVA therapy. Fatal infections have been reported with GAZYVA. Do not administer GAZYVA to patients with an active infection. Patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections may be at increased risk of infection.  \n\n\n\n    5.6 Neutropenia\n\n\n\n   GAZYVA in combination with chlorambucil caused Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in 33% of patients in the trial. Patients with Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia should be monitored frequently with regular laboratory tests until resolution. Anticipate, evaluate, and treat any symptoms or signs of developing infection.  \n\n\n\n Neutropenia can also be of late onset (occurring more than 28 days after completion of treatment) and/or prolonged (lasting longer than 28 days).\n\n\n\n Patients with neutropenia are strongly recommended to receive antimicrobial prophylaxis throughout the treatment period. Antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis should be considered.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Thrombocytopenia\n\n\n\n   GAZYVA in combination with chlorambucil caused Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in 10% of patients in the trial. In 4% of patients, GAZYVA caused acute thrombocytopenia occurring within 24 hours after the GAZYVA infusion. Fatal hemorrhagic events during Cycle 1 have also been reported in patients treated with GAZYVA.  \n\n\n\n Monitor all patients frequently for thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic events, especially during the first cycle. In patients with Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, monitor platelet counts more frequently until resolution and consider subsequent dose delays of GAZYVA and chlorambucil or dose reductions of chlorambucil. Transfusion of blood products (i.e., platelet transfusion) may be necessary. Consider withholding concomitant medications which may increase bleeding risk (platelet inhibitors, anticoagulants), especially during the first cycle.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Immunization\n\n\n\n  The safety and efficacy of immunization with live or attenuated viral vaccines during or following GAZYVA therapy has not been studied. Immunization with live virus vaccines is not recommended during treatment and until B-cell recovery.\n",

(5.1)   \n *     Hypoglycemia: In add-on to sulfonylurea, add-on to insulin, and add-on to metformin plus sulfonylurea trials, confirmed hypoglycemia was more common in patients treated with ONGLYZA compared to placebo. When used with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.  (5.2  ,  6.1)   \n *     Hypersensitivity-Related Events (e.g., urticaria, facial edema): More common in patients treated with ONGLYZA than in patients treated with placebo; and postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Promptly discontinue ONGLYZA, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment, and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes.  (5.3  ,  6.1  ,  6.2)   \n *     Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. (  5.4  ) \n *    There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with ONGLYZA or any other antidiabetic drug.  (5.5)   \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Pancreatitis\n\n\n\n  There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking ONGLYZA. After initiation of ONGLYZA, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, ONGLYZA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using ONGLYZA.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Sulfonylurea or Insulin\n\n\n\n  When ONGLYZA was used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, medications known to cause hypoglycemia, the incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin. [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Therefore, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with ONGLYZA [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with ONGLYZA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with ONGLYZA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue ONGLYZA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)    ].\n\n\n\n Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with ONGLYZA.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia\n\n\n\n  There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP4 inhibitor. Consider DPP4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\n\n\n  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with ONGLYZA or any other antidiabetic drug.\n",

In an animal model of infection, the antibacterial activity of SIVEXTRO was reduced in the absence of granulocytes. Consider alternative therapies in neutropenic patients. (  5.1  ) \n *   Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (  5.2  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Patients with Neutropenia\n\n\n\n  The safety and efficacy of SIVEXTRO in patients with neutropenia (neutrophil counts <1000 cells/mm  3  ) have not been adequately evaluated. In an animal model of infection, the antibacterial activity of SIVEXTRO was reduced in the absence of granulocytes [ see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)    ]. Alternative therapies should be considered when treating patients with neutropenia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Clostridium difficile  -Associated Diarrhea\n\n\n\n   Clostridium difficile  -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial agents including SIVEXTRO, with severity ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents can alter the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile  .\n\n\n\n  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.\n\n\n\n If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile  should be discontinued, if possible. Appropriate measures such as fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria\n\n\n\n  Prescribing SIVEXTRO in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *   Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, arrhythmia, seizures, and renal impairment: Encourage adequate hydration, assess concurrent medications, and consider laboratory assessments prior to and after use (  5.1  ,  5.2  ,  5.3  ,  5.4  ) \n *   Risks in patients with renal insufficiency or patients taking concomitant medications that affect renal function: Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider testing (  5.3  ) \n *   Mucosal ulcerations: Consider potential for mucosal ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease (  5.5  ) \n *   Suspected GI obstruction or perforation: Rule out diagnosis before administration (  4  ,  5.6  ) \n *   Patients at risk for aspiration: Observe during administration (  5.7  ) \n *   Not for direct ingestion: Dissolve and take with additional water (  5.8  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities\n\n\n\n  Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of Prepopik  (r)  . Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure when replacing fluids. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration including signs of orthostatic hypotension after taking Prepopik  (r)  , consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) and treat accordingly. Approximately 20% of patients in both arms (Prepopik  (r)  , 2L of PEG + E plus two * 5-mg bisacodyl tablets) of clinical trials of Prepopik  (r)  had orthostatic changes (changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate) on the day of colonoscopy. In clinical trials orthostatic changes were documented out to seven days post colonoscopy. [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1  ,  6.2)  ]  \n\n\n\n Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias or seizures and renal impairment. Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected before treatment with Prepopik  (r)  . In addition, use caution when prescribing Prepopik  (r)  for patients who have conditions or who are using medications that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or that may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmia, and renal impairment.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Seizures\n\n\n\n  There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures with the use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.\n\n\n\n Use caution when prescribing Prepopik  (r)  for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, patients with known or suspected hyponatremia. [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment\n\n\n\n  As in other magnesium containing bowel preparations, use caution when prescribing Prepopik  (r)  for patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). These patients may be at increased risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during and after the use of Prepopik  (r)  . Consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients. In patients with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), accumulation of magnesium in plasma may occur.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Cardiac Arrhythmias\n\n\n\n  There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing Prepopik  (r)  for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulceration, Ischemic Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis\n\n\n\n  Osmotic laxatives may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of additional stimulant laxatives with Prepopik  (r)  may increase this risk. The potential for mucosal ulcerations should be considered when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  \n\n\n\n    5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease\n\n\n\n  If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering Prepopik  (r)  . Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Aspiration\n\n\n\n  Patients with impaired gag reflex and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration should be observed during the administration of Prepopik  (r)  . Use with caution in these patients.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Not for Direct Ingestion\n\n\n\n  Each packet must be dissolved in 5 ounces of cold water and administered at separate times according to the dosing regimen. Ingestion of additional water is important to patient tolerance. Direct ingestion of the undissolved powder may increase the risk of nausea, vomiting, dehydration, and electrolyte disturbances.\n",

        "section_text": "    5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Elevated liver enzymes: ALT, AST, and bilirubin elevations have occurred with OFEV. Monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin before and during treatment. Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations may be required. (  2.1  ,  5.1  ) \n *  Gastrointestinal disorders: Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting have occurred with OFEV. Treat patients at first signs with adequate hydration and antidiarrheal medicine (e.g., loperamide) or anti-emetics. Discontinue OFEV if severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting persists despite symptomatic treatment. (  5.2  ) \n *  Embryofetal toxicity: Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. (  5.3  ) \n *  Arterial thromboembolic events have been reported. Use caution when treating patients at higher cardiovascular risk including known coronary artery disease. (  5.4  ) \n *  Bleeding events have been reported. Use OFEV in patients with known bleeding risk only if anticipated benefit outweighs the potential risk. (  5.5  ) \n *  Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported. Use OFEV with caution when treating patients with recent abdominal surgery. Discontinue OFEV in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation. Only use OFEV in patients with known risk of gastrointestinal perforation if the anticipated benefit outweighs the potential risk. (  5.6  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Elevated Liver Enzymes\n\n\n\n  The safety and efficacy of OFEV has not been studied in patients with moderate (Child Pugh B) or severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Treatment with OFEV is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].  \n\n\n\n In clinical trials, administration of OFEV was associated with elevations of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALKP, GGT). Liver enzyme increases were reversible with dose modification or interruption and not associated with clinical signs or symptoms of liver injury. The majority (94%) of patients with ALT and/or AST elevations had elevations <5 times ULN. Administration of OFEV was also associated with elevations of bilirubin. The majority (95%) of patients with bilirubin elevations had elevations <2 times ULN [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )].  \n\n\n\n Conduct liver function tests (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) prior to treatment with OFEV, monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Dosage modifications or interruption may be necessary for liver enzyme elevations [see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ,  2.3  )].  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Gastrointestinal Disorders\n\n\n\n   Diarrhea  Diarrhea was the most frequent gastrointestinal event reported in 62% versus 18% of patients treated with OFEV and placebo, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )].  In most patients, the event was of mild to moderate intensity and occurred within the first 3 months of treatment. Diarrhea led to permanent dose reduction in 11% of patients treated with OFEV compared to 0 placebo-treated patients. Diarrhea led to discontinuation of OFEV in 5% of the patients compared to <1% of placebo-treated patients.\n\n\n\n Dosage modifications or treatment interruptions may be necessary in patients with adverse reactions of diarrhea. Treat diarrhea at first signs with adequate hydration and antidiarrheal medication (e.g., loperamide), and consider treatment interruption if diarrhea continues [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )].  OFEV treatment may be resumed at the full dosage (150 mg twice daily), or at the reduced dosage (100 mg twice daily), which subsequently may be increased to the full dosage. If severe diarrhea persists despite symptomatic treatment, discontinue treatment with OFEV.\n\n\n\n  Nausea and Vomiting  Nausea was reported in 24% versus 7% and vomiting was reported in 12% versus 3% of patients treated with OFEV and placebo, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . In most patients, these events were of mild to moderate intensity. Nausea led to discontinuation of OFEV in 2% of patients. Vomiting led to discontinuation of OFEV in 1% of the patients.\n\n\n\n For nausea or vomiting that persists despite appropriate supportive care including anti-emetic therapy, dose reduction or treatment interruption may be required [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  . OFEV treatment may be resumed at the full dosage (150 mg twice daily), or at the reduced dosage (100 mg twice daily), which subsequently may be increased to the full dosage. If severe nausea or vomiting does not resolve, discontinue treatment with OFEV.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Embryofetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  OFEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Nintedanib was teratogenic and embryofetocidal in rats and rabbits at less than and approximately 5 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) in adults (on an AUC basis at oral doses of 2.5 and 15 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively). If OFEV is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking OFEV, the patient should be advised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with OFEV and to use adequate contraception during treatment and at least 3 months after the last dose of OFEV [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )].  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Arterial Thromboembolic Events\n\n\n\n  Arterial thromboembolic events have been reported in patients taking OFEV. In clinical trials, arterial thromboembolic events were reported in 2.5% of patients treated with OFEV and 0.8% of placebo-treated patients. Myocardial infarction was the most common adverse reaction under arterial thromboembolic events, occurring in 1.5% of OFEV-treated patients compared to 0.4% of placebo-treated patients.\n\n\n\n Use caution when treating patients at higher cardiovascular risk including known coronary artery disease. Consider treatment interruption in patients who develop signs or symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Risk of Bleeding\n\n\n\n  Based on the mechanism of action (VEGFR inhibition), OFEV may increase the risk of bleeding. In clinical trials, bleeding events were reported in 10% of patients treated with OFEV and in 7% of patients treated with placebo.\n\n\n\n Use OFEV in patients with known risk of bleeding only if the anticipated benefit outweighs the potential risk.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Gastrointestinal Perforation\n\n\n\n  Based on the mechanism of action, OFEV may increase the risk of gastrointestinal perforation. In clinical trials, gastrointestinal perforation was reported in 0.3% of patients treated with OFEV, compared to 0 cases in the placebo-treated patients.\n\n\n\n Use caution when treating patients who have had recent abdominal surgery. Discontinue therapy with OFEV in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation. Only use OFEV in patients with known risk of gastrointestinal perforation if the anticipated benefit outweighs the potential risk.\n",

(  5.1  ) \n *  Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. (  5.2  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 General Risk of Bleeding\n\n\n\n  Antiplatelet agents, including ZONTIVITY, increase the risk of bleeding, including ICH and fatal bleeding [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n ZONTIVITY increases the risk of bleeding in proportion to the patient's underlying bleeding risk. Consider the underlying risk of bleeding before initiating ZONTIVITY. General risk factors for bleeding include older age, low body weight, reduced renal or hepatic function, history of bleeding disorders, and use of certain concomitant medications (e.g., anticoagulants, fibrinolytic therapy, chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDS], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) increases the risk of bleeding [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . Avoid concomitant use of warfarin or other anticoagulants.\n\n\n\n Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), or other surgical procedures.\n\n\n\n Withholding ZONTIVITY for a brief period will not be useful in managing an acute bleeding event because of its long half-life. There is no known treatment to reverse the antiplatelet effect of ZONTIVITY. Significant inhibition of platelet aggregation remains 4 weeks after discontinuation [see     Overdosage (10)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2  ,  12.3)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors or Inducers\n\n\n\n  Strong CYP3A inhibitors increase and inducers decrease ZONTIVITY exposure. Avoid concomitant use of ZONTIVITY with strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .\n",

(  5.1  ) \n *  Valvular heart disease: If signs or symptoms develop consider BELVIQ discontinuation and evaluate the patient for possible valvulopathy. (  5.2  ) \n *  Cognitive Impairment: May cause disturbances in attention or memory. Caution with use of hazardous machinery when starting BELVIQ treatment. (  5.3  ) \n *  Psychiatric Disorders, including euphoria and dissociation: Do not exceed recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily. (  5.4  ) \n *  Monitor for depression or suicidal thoughts. Discontinue if symptoms develop. (  5.4  ) \n *  Use of Antidiabetic Medications: weight loss may cause hypoglycemia. Monitor blood glucose. BELVIQ has not been studied in patients taking insulin. (  5.5  ) \n *  Priapism: Patients should seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts >4 hours. Use BELVIQ with caution in patients predisposed to priapism. (  5.6  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Serotonin Syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-like Reactions\n\n\n\n  BELVIQ is a serotonergic drug. The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-like reactions have been reported during use of serotonergic drugs, including, but not limited to, selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), bupropion, triptans, dietary supplements such as St. John's Wort and tryptophan, drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]), dextromethorphan, lithium, tramadol, antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists, particularly when used in combination [ see Drug Interactions (  7.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form, can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms.\n\n\n\n The safety of BELVIQ when coadministered with other serotonergic or antidopaminergic agents, including antipsychotics, or drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, including MAOIs, has not been systematically evaluated and has not been established.\n\n\n\n If concomitant administration of BELVIQ with an agent that affects the serotonergic neurotransmitter system is clinically warranted, extreme caution and careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Treatment with BELVIQ and any concomitant serotonergic or antidopaminergic agents, including antipsychotics, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ) and Drug Interactions (  7.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.2 Valvular Heart Disease\n\n\n\n  Regurgitant cardiac valvular disease, primarily affecting the mitral and/or aortic valves, has been reported in patients who took serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2Breceptor agonist activity. The etiology of the regurgitant valvular disease is thought to be activation of 5-HT2Breceptors on cardiac interstitial cells. At therapeutic concentrations, BELVIQ is selective for 5-HT2Creceptors as compared to 5-HT2Breceptors. In clinical trials of 1-year duration, 2.4% of patients receiving BELVIQ and 2.0% of patients receiving placebo developed echocardiographic criteria for valvular regurgitation at one year (mild or greater aortic regurgitation and/or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation): none of these patients was symptomatic [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ) see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n BELVIQ has not been studied in patients with congestive heart failure or hemodynamically-significant valvular heart disease. Preliminary data suggest that 5HT2Breceptors may be overexpressed in congestive heart failure, Therefore, BELVIQ should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure.\n\n\n\n BELVIQ should not be used in combination with serotonergic and dopaminergic drugs that are potent 5-HT2Breceptor agonists and are known to increase the risk for cardiac valvulopathy (e.g., cabergoline).\n\n\n\n Patients who develop signs or symptoms of valvular heart disease, including dyspnea, dependent edema, congestive heart failure, or a new cardiac murmur while being treated with BELVIQ should be evaluated and discontinuation of BELVIQ should be considered.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Cognitive Impairment\n\n\n\n  In clinical trials of at least one year in duration, impairments in attention and memory were reported adverse reactions associated with 1.9% of patients treated with BELVIQ and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo, and led to discontinuation in 0.3% and 0.1% of these patients, respectively. Other reported adverse reactions associated with BELVIQ in clinical trials included confusion, somnolence, and fatigue [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n Since BELVIQ has the potential to impair cognitive function, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that BELVIQ therapy does not affect them adversely [ see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.4 Psychiatric Disorders\n\n\n\n  Events of euphoria, hallucination, and dissociation were seen with BELVIQ at supratherapeutic doses in short-term studies [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  ), Drug Abuse and Dependence (  9.2  ), and Overdosage (  10  )  ]. In clinical trials of at least 1-year in duration, 6 patients (0.2%) treated with BELVIQ developed euphoria, as compared with 1 patient (<0.1%) treated with placebo. Doses of BELVIQ should not exceed 10 mg twice a day.\n\n\n\n Some drugs that target the central nervous system have been associated with depression or suicidal ideation. Patients treated with BELVIQ should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Discontinue BELVIQ in patients who experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.5 Potential Risk of Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus on Anti-diabetic Therapy\n\n\n\n  Weight loss may increase the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin and/or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas); hypoglycemia was observed in clinical trials with BELVIQ. BELVIQ has not been studied in combination with insulin. Measurement of blood glucose levels prior to starting BELVIQ and during BELVIQ treatment is recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes. Decreases in medication doses for anti-diabetic medications which are non-glucose-dependent should be considered to mitigate the risk of hypoglycemia. If a patient develops hypoglycemia after starting BELVIQ, appropriate changes should be made to the anti-diabetic drug regimen [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.6 Priapism\n\n\n\n  Priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) is a potential effect of 5-HT2Creceptor agonism.\n\n\n\n If not treated promptly, priapism can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Men who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should immediately discontinue the drug and seek emergency medical attention.\n\n\n\n BELVIQ should be used with caution in men who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (e.g., sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in men with anatomical deformation of the penis (e.g., angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease). There is limited experience with the combination of BELVIQ and medication indicated for erectile dysfunction (e.g., phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors). Therefore, the combination of BELVIQ and these medications should be used with caution.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Heart Rate Decreases\n\n\n\n  In clinical trials of at least 1-year in duration, the mean change in heart rate (HR) was -1.2 beats per minute (bpm) in BELVIQ and -0.4 bpm in placebo-treated patients without diabetes and -2.0 beats per minute (bpm) in BELVIQ and -0.4 bpm in placebo-treated patients with type 2 diabetes. The incidence of HR less than 50 bpm was 5.3% in BELVIQ and 3.2% in placebo-treated patients without diabetes and 3.6% in BELVIQ and 2.0% in placebo-treated patients with type 2 diabetes. In the combined population, adverse reactions of bradycardia occurred in 0.3% of BELVIQ and 0.1% of placebo-treated patients. Use with caution in patients with bradycardia or a history of heart block greater than first degree.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Hematological Changes\n\n\n\n  In clinical trials of at least one year in duration, adverse reactions of decreases in white blood cell count (including leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and decreased white cell count) were reported in 0.4% of patients treated with BELVIQ as compared to 0.2% of patients treated with placebo. Adverse reactions of decreases in red blood cell count (including anemia and decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit) were reported by 1.3% of patients treated with BELVIQ as compared to 1.2% treated with placebo [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ]. Consider periodic monitoring of complete blood count during treatment with BELVIQ.\n\n\n\n    5.9 Prolactin Elevation\n\n\n\n  Lorcaserin moderately elevates prolactin levels. In a subset of placebo-controlled clinical trials of at least one year in duration, elevations of prolactin greater than the upper limit of normal, two times the upper limit of normal, and five times the upper limit of normal, measured both before and 2 hours after dosing, occurred in 6.7%, 1.7%, and 0.1% of BELVIQ-treated patients and 4.8%, 0.8%, and 0.0% of placebo-treated patients, respectively [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ]. Prolactin should be measured when symptoms and signs of prolactin excess are suspected (e.g., galactorrhea, gynecomastia). There was one patient treated with BELVIQ who developed a prolactinoma during the trial. The relationship of BELVIQ to the prolactinoma in this patient is unknown.\n\n\n\n    5.10 Pulmonary Hypertension\n\n\n\n  Certain centrally-acting weight loss agents that act on the serotonin system have been associated with pulmonary hypertension, a rare but lethal disease. Because of the low incidence of this disease, the clinical trial experience with BELVIQ is inadequate to determine if BELVIQ increases the risk for pulmonary hypertension.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Infections: Serious infections have occurred. Do not start STELARA  (r)  during any clinically important active infection. If a serious infection develops, stop STELARA  (r)  until the infection resolves. (  5.1  ) \n *  Theoretical Risk for Particular Infections: Serious infections from mycobacteria, salmonella and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations have been reported in patients genetically deficient in IL-12/IL-23. Diagnostic tests for these infections should be considered as dictated by clinical circumstances. (  5.2  ) \n *  Tuberculosis (TB): Evaluate patients for TB prior to initiating treatment with STELARA  (r)  . Initiate treatment of latent TB before administering STELARA  (r)  . (  5.3  ) \n *  Malignancies: STELARA  (r)  may increase risk of malignancy. The safety of STELARA  (r)  in patients with a history of or a known malignancy has not been evaluated. (  5.4  ) \n *  Anaphylaxis or other clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions may occur. (  5.5  ) \n *  Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS): One case was reported. If suspected, treat promptly and discontinue STELARA  (r)  . (  5.6  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Infections\n\n\n\n  STELARA  (r)  may increase the risk of infections and reactivation of latent infections. Serious bacterial, fungal, and viral infections were observed in subjects receiving STELARA  (r)   [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n STELARA  (r)  should not be given to patients with any clinically important active infection. STELARA  (r)  should not be administered until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. Exercise caution when considering the use of STELARA  (r)  in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection.\n\n\n\n  Serious infections requiring hospitalization occurred in the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis development programs. In the psoriasis program, serious infections included diverticulitis, cellulitis, pneumonia, appendicitis, cholecystitis, sepsis, osteomyelitis, viral infections, gastroenteritis and urinary tract infections. In the psoriatic arthritis program, serious infections included cholecystitis.  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Theoretical Risk for Vulnerability to Particular Infections\n\n\n\n  Individuals genetically deficient in IL-12/IL-23 are particularly vulnerable to disseminated infections from mycobacteria (including nontuberculous, environmental mycobacteria), salmonella (including nontyphi strains), and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations. Serious infections and fatal outcomes have been reported in such patients.\n\n\n\n It is not known whether patients with pharmacologic blockade of IL-12/IL-23 from treatment with STELARA  (r)  will be susceptible to these types of infections. Appropriate diagnostic testing should be considered, e.g., tissue culture, stool culture, as dictated by clinical circumstances.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Pre-treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis\n\n\n\n  Evaluate patients for tuberculosis infection prior to initiating treatment with STELARA  (r)  .\n\n\n\n Do not administer STELARA  (r)  to patients with active tuberculosis. Initiate treatment of latent tuberculosis prior to administering STELARA  (r)  . Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of STELARA  (r)  in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Patients receiving STELARA  (r)  should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis during and after treatment.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Malignancies\n\n\n\n  STELARA  (r)  is an immunosuppressant and may increase the risk of malignancy. Malignancies were reported among subjects who received STELARA  (r)  in clinical studies [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . In rodent models, inhibition of IL-12/IL-23p40 increased the risk of malignancy [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13)  ]  .\n\n\n\n The safety of STELARA  (r)  has not been evaluated in patients who have a history of malignancy or who have a known malignancy.\n\n\n\n There have been post marketing reports of the rapid appearance of multiple cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in patients receiving STELARA  (r)  who had pre-existing risk factors for developing non-melanoma skin cancer. All patients receiving STELARA  (r)  should be monitored for the appearance of non-melanoma skin cancer. Patients greater than 60 years of age, those with a medical history of prolonged immunosuppressant therapy and those with a history of PUVA treatment should be followed closely [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n   Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported post-marketing. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate therapy and discontinue STELARA  (r)   [see  Adverse Reactions (6.3)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.6 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome\n\n\n\n   One case of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) was observed in the clinical trial safety databases for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. The subject, who had received 12 doses of STELARA  (r)  over approximately two years, presented with headache, seizures and confusion. No additional STELARA  (r)  injections were administered and the subject fully recovered with appropriate treatment..  \n\n\n\n RPLS is a neurological disorder, which is not caused by demyelination or a known infectious agent. RPLS can present with headache, seizures, confusion and visual disturbances. Conditions with which it has been associated include preeclampsia, eclampsia, acute hypertension, cytotoxic agents and immunosuppressive therapy. Fatal outcomes have been reported.\n\n\n\n  If RPLS is suspected, administer appropriate treatment and discontinue STELARA  (r)  .  \n\n\n\n    5.7 Immunizations\n\n\n\n  Prior to initiating therapy with STELARA  (r)  , patients should receive all immunizations appropriate for age as recommended by current immunization guidelines. Patients being treated with STELARA  (r)  should not receive live vaccines. BCG vaccines should not be given during treatment with STELARA  (r)  or for one year prior to initiating treatment or one year following discontinuation of treatment. Caution is advised when administering live vaccines to household contacts of patients receiving STELARA  (r)  because of the potential risk for shedding from the household contact and transmission to patient.\n\n\n\n Non-live vaccinations received during a course of STELARA  (r)  may not elicit an immune response sufficient to prevent disease.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Concomitant Therapies\n\n\n\n   In psoriasis studies the safety of STELARA  (r)  in combination with other immunosuppressive agents or phototherapy has not been evaluated. In psoriatic arthritis studies, concomitant MTX use did not appear to influence the safety or efficacy of STELARA  (r)   [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ].  Ultraviolet-induced skin cancers developed earlier and more frequently in mice genetically manipulated to be deficient in both IL-12 and IL-23 or IL-12 alone [see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13)  ]  .  \n",

Reduction in the infusion rate and/or pre-medication may prevent subsequent reactions (  5.1  ,  6.3  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis\n\n\n\n   Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred in some patients treated with ELELYSO. In clinical trials, 2 of 72 (2.8%) patients treated with ELELYSO experienced signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of these patients included urticaria, hypotension, flushing, wheezing, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. These reactions occurred during ELELYSO infusion.  \n\n\n\n  In clinical trials with ELELYSO, 21 of 72 (29%) patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions included pruritus, angioedema, flushing, erythema, rash, nausea, vomiting, cough, chest tightness, and throat irritation. These reactions have occurred up to 3 hours after the start of infusion [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n  Due to the potential for anaphylaxis, appropriate medical support should be readily available when ELELYSO is administered. Observe patients closely for an appropriate period of time after administration of ELELYSO, taking into account the time to onset of anaphylaxis seen in clinical trials. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur. If anaphylaxis occurs, ELELYSO should be immediately discontinued, and appropriate medical treatment should be initiated.  \n\n\n\n  Management of hypersensitivity reactions should be based on the severity of the reaction and include slowing or temporary interruption of the infusion and/or administration of antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids for mild reactions. Pretreatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may prevent subsequent hypersensitivity reactions. Patients were not routinely premedicated prior to infusion of ELELYSO during clinical studies. If severe hypersensitivity reactions occur, immediately stop the infusion of ELELYSO and initiate appropriate treatment.  \n\n\n\n  Consider the risks and benefits of re-administering ELELYSO in patients who have experienced a severe reaction associated with ELELYSO. Caution should be exercised upon rechallenge, and appropriate medical support should be readily available [see  Adverse Reactions (6.3)  ].    \n",

        "section_text": "    5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Do not initiate STRIVERDI RESPIMAT in acutely deteriorating COPD patients (  5.2  ) \n *  Do not use for relief of acute symptoms. Concomitant short-acting beta2-agonists can be used as needed for acute relief. (  5.2  ) \n *  Do not exceed the recommended dose. Excessive use of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, or use in conjunction with other medications containing LABA can result in clinically significant cardiovascular effects and may be fatal. (  5.3  ) \n *  Life-threatening paradoxical bronchospasm can occur. Discontinue STRIVERDI RESPIMAT immediately. (  5.4  ) \n *  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular or convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis or sensitivity to sympathomimetic drugs (  5.5  ,  5.6  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Asthma-Related Death [ see Boxed Warning  ]\n\n\n\n    *   Data from a large placebo-controlled study in asthma patients showed that long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists may increase the risk of asthma-related death. Data are not available to determine whether the rate of death in patients with COPD is increased by long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists.  \n *   A 28-week, placebo-controlled US study comparing the safety of another long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (salmeterol) with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in patients treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in patients treated with placebo; RR 4.37, 95% CI 1.25, 15.34). The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists, including STRIVERDI RESPIMAT. No study adequate to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased in patients treated with STRIVERDI RESPIMAT has been conducted. The safety and efficacy of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT in patients with asthma have not been established. STRIVERDI RESPIMAT is not indicated for the treatment of asthma [ see Contraindications (  4  ) ].  \n       5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes\n \n\n  STRIVERDI RESPIMAT should not be initiated in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD, which may be a life-threatening condition. STRIVERDI RESPIMAT has not been studied in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD. The use of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT in this setting is inappropriate.\n\n\n\n STRIVERDI RESPIMAT should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. STRIVERDI RESPIMAT has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist.\n\n\n\n When beginning STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., four times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. Increasing inhaled beta2-agonist use is a signal of deteriorating disease for which prompt medical attention is indicated.\n\n\n\n COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If STRIVERDI RESPIMAT no longer controls symptoms of bronchoconstriction, or the patient's inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist becomes less effective or the patient needs more inhalation of short-acting beta2-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting, a re-evaluation of the patient and the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. Increasing the daily dosage of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT beyond the recommended dose is not appropriate in this situation.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Excessive Use of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT and Use with Long-Acting Beta2-Agonists\n\n\n\n  As with other inhaled drugs containing beta2-adrenergic agents, STRIVERDI RESPIMAT should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medications containing long-acting beta2-agonists, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Paradoxical Bronchospasm\n\n\n\n  As with other inhaled beta2-agonists, STRIVERDI RESPIMAT may produce paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, STRIVERDI RESPIMAT should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Cardiovascular Effects\n\n\n\n  STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, like other beta2-agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and/or symptoms. If such effects occur, STRIVERDI RESPIMAT may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce ECG changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Long acting beta2-adrenergic agonists should be administered with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and hypertension.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Co-existing Conditions\n\n\n\n  STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis, in patients with known or suspected prolongation of the QT interval, and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta2-agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate pre-existing diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia\n\n\n\n  Beta-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects [ see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )  ]. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Inhalation of high doses of beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce increases in plasma glucose.\n\n\n\n In patients with severe COPD, hypokalemia may be potentiated by hypoxia and concomitant treatment [ see Drug Interactions (  7.2  )  ], which may increase the susceptibility for cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n\n\n Clinically notable decreases in serum potassium or changes in blood glucose were infrequent during clinical studies with long-term administration of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT with the rates similar to those for placebo controls. STRIVERDI RESPIMAT has not been investigated in patients whose diabetes mellitus is not well controlled.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, may occur after administration of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with STRIVERDI RESPIMAT should be stopped at once and alternative treatment should be considered.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Daytime somnolence: Risk of impaired alertness and motor coordination, including impaired driving; risk increases with dose; caution patients taking 20 mg against next-day driving and other activities requiring complete mental alertness (  5.1  ). \n *  Need to evaluate for co-morbid diagnoses: Reevaluate if insomnia persists after 7 to 10 days of treatment (  5.2  ). \n *  Nighttime \"sleep-driving\" and other complex behaviors while out of bed and not fully awake. Risk increases with dose, with use of CNS depressants, and with alcohol (  5.3  ). \n *  Depression: Worsening of depression or suicidal thinking may occur. Risk increases with dose. Immediately evaluate any new behavioral changes (  5.4  ). \n *  Compromised respiratory function: Effect on respiratory function should be considered (  5.5  ,  8.6  ). \n *  Sleep paralysis, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and cataplexy-like symptoms: Risk increases with dose (  5.6  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 CNS Depressant Effects and Daytime Impairment\n\n\n\n  BELSOMRA is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant that can impair daytime wakefulness even when used as prescribed. Prescribers should monitor for somnolence and CNS depressant effects, but impairment can occur in the absence of symptoms, and may not be reliably detected by ordinary clinical exam (i.e., less than formal testing of daytime wakefulness and/or psychomotor performance). CNS depressant effects may persist in some patients for up to several days after discontinuing BELSOMRA.\n\n\n\n BELSOMRA can impair driving skills and may increase the risk of falling asleep while driving. Discontinue or decrease the dose in patients who drive if daytime somnolence develops. In a study of healthy adults, driving ability was impaired in some individuals taking 20 mg BELSOMRA [see  Clinical Studies (14.2)  ].  Although pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some adverse depressant effects of BELSOMRA may develop with daily use, patients using the 20 mg dose of BELSOMRA should be cautioned against next-day driving and other activities requiring full mental alertness. Patients taking lower doses of BELSOMRA should also be cautioned about the potential for driving impairment because there is individual variation in sensitivity to BELSOMRA.\n\n\n\n Co-administration with other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol) increases the risk of CNS depression. Patients should be advised not to consume alcohol in combination with BELSOMRA because of additive effects [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  . Dosage adjustments of BELSOMRA and of concomitant CNS depressants may be necessary when administered together because of potentially additive effects. The use of BELSOMRA with other drugs to treat insomnia is not recommended [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ].  \n\n\n\n The risk of next-day impairment, including impaired driving, is increased if BELSOMRA is taken with less than a full night of sleep remaining, if a higher than the recommended dose is taken, if co-administered with other CNS depressants, or if co-administered with other drugs that increase blood levels of BELSOMRA. Patients should be cautioned against driving and other activities requiring complete mental alertness if BELSOMRA is taken in these circumstances.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Need to Evaluate for Co-morbid Diagnoses\n\n\n\n  Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new cognitive or behavioral abnormalities may be the result of an unrecognized underlying psychiatric or physical disorder, and can emerge during the course of treatment with hypnotic drugs such as BELSOMRA.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes\n\n\n\n  A variety of cognitive and behavioral changes (e.g., amnesia, anxiety, hallucinations and other neuro-psychiatric symptoms) have been reported to occur in association with the use of hypnotics such as BELSOMRA. Complex behaviors such as \"sleep-driving\" (i.e., driving while not fully awake after taking a hypnotic) and other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex), with amnesia for the event, have been reported in association with the use of hypnotics. These events can occur in hypnotic-naive as well as in hypnotic-experienced persons. The use of alcohol and other CNS depressants may increase the risk of such behaviors. Discontinuation of BELSOMRA should be strongly considered for patients who report any complex sleep behavior.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Worsening of Depression/Suicidal Ideation\n\n\n\n  In clinical studies, a dose-dependent increase in suicidal ideation was observed in patients taking BELSOMRA as assessed by questionnaire. Immediately evaluate patients with suicidal ideation or any new behavioral sign or symptom.\n\n\n\n In primarily depressed patients treated with sedative-hypnotics, worsening of depression, and suicidal thoughts and actions (including completed suicides) have been reported. Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients and protective measures may be required. Intentional overdose is more common in this group of patients; therefore, the lowest number of tablets that is feasible should be prescribed for the patient at any one time.\n\n\n\n The emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Patients with Compromised Respiratory Function\n\n\n\n  Effect of BELSOMRA on respiratory function should be considered if prescribed to patients with compromised respiratory function. BELSOMRA has not been studied in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.6 Sleep Paralysis, Hypnagogic/Hypnopompic Hallucinations, Cataplexy-like Symptoms\n\n\n\n  Sleep paralysis, an inability to move or speak for up to several minutes during sleep-wake transitions, and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, including vivid and disturbing perceptions by the patient, can occur with the use of BELSOMRA. Prescribers should explain the nature of these events to patients when prescribing BELSOMRA.\n\n\n\n Symptoms similar to mild cataplexy can occur, with risk increasing with the dose of BELSOMRA. Such symptoms can include periods of leg weakness lasting from seconds to a few minutes, can occur both at night and during the day, and may not be associated with an identified triggering event (e.g., laughter or surprise).\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  In patients with MDS, Nplate increases blast cell counts and increases the risk of progression to acute myelogenous leukemia. (  5.1  ) \n *  Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications may result from increases in platelet counts with Nplate use. Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease receiving Nplate. Use with additional caution in ITP patients with chronic liver disease. (  5.2  ) \n *  Discontinuation of Nplate may result in worsened thrombocytopenia than was present prior to Nplate therapy. Monitor complete blood counts (CBCs), including platelet counts, for at least 2 weeks following Nplate discontinuation. (  5.4  ) \n *  If severe thrombocytopenia develops during Nplate treatment, assess patients for the formation of neutralizing antibodies. (  5.5  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Risk of Progression of Myelodysplastic Syndromes to Acute Myelogenous Leukemia\n\n\n\n  Progression from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) has been observed in clinical trials with Nplate.  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolling patients with severe thrombocytopenia and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) low or intermediate-1 risk MDS was terminated due to more cases of AML observed in the Nplate treatment arm.  At the time of an interim analysis, among 219 MDS patients randomized 2:1 to treatment with Nplate or placebo (147 Nplate: 72 placebo), 11 patients showed progression to AML, including nine on the Nplate arm versus two on the placebo arm.  In addition, in peripheral blood counts, the percentage of circulating myeloblasts increased to greater than 10% in 28 patients, 25 of whom were in the romiplostim treatment arm.  Of the 28 patients who had an increase in circulating myeloblasts to greater than 10%, eight of these patients were diagnosed to have AML and 20 patients had not progressed to AML. In four patients, increased peripheral blood blast cell counts decreased to baseline after discontinuation of Nplate.  In a single-arm trial of Nplate given to 72 patients with thrombocytopenia related to MDS, eight (11%) patients were reported as having possible disease progression, and three patients had confirmation of AML during follow-up.  In addition, in three patients, increased peripheral blood blast cell counts decreased to baseline after discontinuation of Nplate.\n\n\n\n Nplate is not indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to MDS or any cause of thrombocytopenia other than chronic ITP.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Thrombotic/Thromboembolic Complications\n\n\n\n  Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications may result from increases in platelet counts with Nplate use.  Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease receiving Nplate.  Nplate should be used with caution in patients with ITP and chronic liver disease.\n\n\n\n To minimize the risk for thrombotic/thromboembolic complications, do not use Nplate in an attempt to normalize platelet counts. Follow the dose adjustment guidelines to achieve and maintain a platelet count of >= 50 x 10  9  /L [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.3 Bone Marrow Reticulin Formation and Risk for Bone Marrow Fibrosis\n\n\n\n  Nplate administration may increase the risk for development or progression of reticulin fiber formation within the bone marrow. This formation may improve upon discontinuation of Nplate.  In a clinical trial, one patient with ITP and hemolytic anemia developed marrow fibrosis with collagen during Nplate therapy.  Clinical trials are in progress to assess the risk of bone marrow fibrosis and clinical consequences with cytopenias.\n\n\n\n If new or worsening morphological abnormalities or cytopenia(s) occur, consider a bone marrow biopsy to include staining for fibrosis [ see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.4 Worsened Thrombocytopenia after Cessation of Nplate\n\n\n\n  In clinical studies of patients with chronic ITP who had Nplate discontinued, four of 57 patients developed thrombocytopenia of greater severity than was present prior to Nplate therapy.  This worsened thrombocytopenia resolved within 14 days.  Following discontinuation of Nplate, obtain weekly CBCs, including platelet counts, for at least 2 weeks and consider alternative treatments for worsening thrombocytopenia, according to current treatment guidelines [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.5 Lack or Loss of Response to Nplate\n\n\n\n  Hyporesponsiveness or failure to maintain a platelet response with Nplate should prompt a search for causative factors, including neutralizing antibodies to Nplate [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.3  )  ].  To detect antibody formation, submit blood samples to Amgen (1-800-772-6436).  Amgen will assay these samples for antibodies to Nplate and thrombopoietin (TPO).  Discontinue Nplate if the platelet count does not increase to a level sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding after 4 weeks at the highest weekly dose of 10 mcg/kg.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Laboratory Monitoring\n\n\n\n  Obtain CBCs, including platelet counts, weekly during the dose-adjustment phase of Nplate therapy and then monthly following establishment of a stable Nplate dose.  Obtain CBCs, including platelet counts, weekly for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of Nplate [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  ) and Warnings and Precautions (  5.3  ,  5.4  )  ].\n",

Before using ORBACTIV, inquire carefully about previous hypersensitivity reactions to glycopeptides. Due to the possibility of cross-sensitivity, carefully monitor for signs of hypersensitivity during ORBACTIV infusion in patients with a history of glycopeptide allergy. In the Phase 3 ABSSSI clinical trials, the median onset of hypersensitivity reactions in ORBACTIV-treated patients was 1.2 days and the median duration of these reactions was 2.4 days. [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Infusion Related Reactions\n\n\n\n  Infusion related reactions have been reported with ORBACTIV including pruritus, urticaria or flushing. If reactions do occur, consider slowing or interrupting ORBACTIV infusion. [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  \n\n\n\n    5.5 Clostridium difficile  -associated Diarrhea\n\n\n\n   Clostridium difficile  -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial drugs, including ORBACTIV, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile  .\n\n\n\n  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.\n\n\n\n If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile  may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Osteomyelitis\n\n\n\n  In Phase 3 ABSSSI clinical trials, more cases of osteomyelitis were reported in the ORBACTIV treated arm than in the vancomycin-treated arm. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of osteomyelitis. If osteomyelitis is suspected or diagnosed, institute appropriate alternate antibacterial therapy [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.7 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria\n\n\n\n  Prescribing ORBACTIV in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria [see Patient Counseling Information (  17  )]  .\n",

The following serious adverse reactions of dabrafenib as a single agent, which may occur when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib, are not described in the Full Prescribing Information for MEKINIST:  \n\n\n\n *     Tumor promotion in patients with BRAF wild-type melanoma  \n *     Hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency  \n   *    New primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib. Monitor patients for new malignancies prior to initiation of therapy while on therapy, and following discontinuation of the combination treatment. (  5.1  ,  2.3  ) \n *    Hemorrhage: Major hemorrhagic events can occur in patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding (  5.2  ,  2.3  ) \n *    Venous Thromboembolism: Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can occur in patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib. (  5.3  ,  2.3  ). \n *    Cardiomyopathy: Assess LVEF before treatment, after one month of treatment, then every 2 to 3 months thereafter. (  5.4  ,  2.3  ) \n *    Ocular Toxicities: Perform ophthalmologic evaluation for any visual disturbances. For Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), permanently discontinue MEKINIST. (  5.5  ,  2.3  ) \n *    Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): Withhold MEKINIST for new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for treatment-related ILD or pneumonitis. (  5.6  ,  2.3  ) \n *    Serious Febrile Reactions can occur when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib. (  5.7  ,  2.3  ) \n *    Serious Skin Toxicity: Monitor for skin toxicities and for secondary infections. Discontinue for intolerable Grade 2, or Grade 3 or 4 rash not improving within 3 weeks despite interruption of MEKINIST. (  5.8  ,  2.3  ) \n *    Hyperglycemia: Monitor serum glucose levels in patients with pre-existing diabetes or hyperglycemia. (  5.9  ,  2.3  ) \n *    Embryofetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus. (  5.10  ,  8.1  ,  8.6  ) \n      EXCERPT:   \n \n\n    5.1 New Primary Malignancies  \n\n\n\n   New primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib and with dabrafenib as a single agent [refer to Full Prescribing Information for dabrafenib]  .  \n\n\n\n   Cutaneous Malignancies:    \n\n\n\n  In Trial 2, the incidence of basal cell carcinoma was increased in patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib, with an incidence of 9% (5/55) in patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib compared with 2% (1/53) in patients receiving dabrafenib as a single agent. The range of time to diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma was 28 to 249 days in patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib and was 197 days for the patient receiving dabrafenib as a single agent.  \n\n\n\n  Cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), including keratoacanthoma, occurred in 7% of patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib and 19% of patients receiving dabrafenib as a single agent. The range of time to diagnosis of cuSCC was 136 to 197 days in the combination arm and was 9 to 197 days in the arm receiving dabrafenib as a single agent.  \n\n\n\n  New primary melanoma occurred in 2% (1/53) of patients receiving dabrafenib and in none of the 55 patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib.  \n\n\n\n  Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiation of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib, every 2 months while on therapy, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of the combination. No dose modifications of MEKINIST or dabrafenib are recommended in patients who develop new primary cutaneous malignancies.  \n\n\n\n   Non-Cutaneous Malignancies:    \n\n\n\n  Based on its mechanism of action, dabrafenib may promote growth and development of malignancies with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms [refer to the Full Prescribing Information for dabrafenib]  . In patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib, four cases of non-cutaneous malignancies were identified: KRAS mutation-positive pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 1), recurrent NRAS mutation-positive colorectal carcinoma (n = 1), head and neck carcinoma (n = 1), and glioblastoma (n = 1). Monitor patients receiving the combination closely for signs or symptoms of non-cutaneous malignancies. If used in combination with dabrafenib, no dose modification is required for MEKINIST in patients who develop non-cutaneous malignancies. Permanently discontinue dabrafenib in patients who develop RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies.  \n\n\n\n     5.2 Hemorrhage  \n\n\n\n   Hemorrhages, including major hemorrhages defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, can occur when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib.  \n\n\n\n  In Trial 2, treatment with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib resulted in an increased incidence and severity of any hemorrhagic event: 16% (9/55) of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib compared with 2% (1/53) of patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent. The major hemorrhagic events of intracranial or gastric hemorrhage occurred in 5% (3/55) of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib compared with none of the 53 patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent. Intracranial hemorrhage was fatal in two (4%) patients receiving the combination of MEKINIST and dabrafenib.  \n\n\n\n  Permanently discontinue MEKINIST, and also permanently discontinue dabrafenib if administered in combination, for all Grade 4 hemorrhagic events and for any Grade 3 hemorrhagic events that do not improve. Withhold MEKINIST for up to 3 weeks for Grade 3 hemorrhagic events; if improved resume at a lower dose level. Withhold dabrafenib for Grade 3 hemorrhagic events; if improved resume at a lower dose level.  \n\n\n\n     5.3 Venous Thromboembolism  \n\n\n\n   Venous thromboembolism can occur when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib.  \n\n\n\n  In Trial 2, treatment with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib resulted in an increased incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): 7% (4/55) of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib compared with none of the 53 patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent. Pulmonary embolism was fatal in one (2%) patient receiving the combination of MEKINIST and dabrafenib.  \n\n\n\n  Advise patients to immediately seek medical care if they develop symptoms of DVT or PE, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST and dabrafenib for life threatening PE. Withhold MEKINIST for uncomplicated DVT and PE for up to 3 weeks; if improved, MEKINIST may be resumed at a lower dose level. Do not modify the dose of dabrafenib [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  .  \n\n\n\n     5.4 Cardiomyopathy  \n\n\n\n   Cardiomyopathy can occur when MEKINIST is administered as a single agent or when used in combination with dabrafenib.  \n\n\n\n  In Trial 1, cardiomyopathy (defined as cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction, or decreased left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]) occurred in 7% (14/211) of patients treated with MEKINIST; no chemotherapy-treated patients in Trial 1 developed cardiomyopathy. In Trial 2, cardiomyopathy occurred in 9% (5/55) of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib and in none of patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent. The median time to onset of cardiomyopathy in patients treated with MEKINIST was 63 days (range: 16 to 156 days) for Trial 1 and 86 days (range: 27 to 253 days) for Trial 2.  \n\n\n\n  Cardiomyopathy was identified within the first month of treatment with MEKINIST in 5 of 14 patients in Trial 1 and in 2 of 5 patients in Trial 2. Development of cardiomyopathy resulted in dose reduction (7/211) and/or discontinuation (4/211) of study drug in Trial 1, and resulted in dose reduction (4/55) and/or dose interruption (1/55) in Trial 2. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 10 of 14 (71%) patients in Trial 1 and in all 5 patients in Trial 2.  \n\n\n\n  Across clinical trials of MEKINIST administered either as a single agent (N = 329), or in combination with dabrafenib (N = 202), 11% and 8% of patients, respectively, developed evidence of cardiomyopathy (decrease in LVEF below institutional lower limits of normal with an absolute decrease in LVEF >=10% below baseline). Five percent and 2% in single-agent and in combination trials, respectively, demonstrated a decrease in LVEF below institutional lower limits of normal with an absolute decrease in LVEF of >=20% below baseline.  \n\n\n\n  Assess LVEF by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan before initiation of MEKINIST as a single agent and in combination with dabrafenib, one month after initiation, and then at 2- to 3-month intervals while on treatment. Withhold treatment with MEKINIST for up to 4 weeks if absolute LVEF value decreases by 10% from pretreatment values and is less than the lower limit of normal. For symptomatic cardiomyopathy or persistent, asymptomatic LV dysfunction that does not resolve within 4 weeks, permanently discontinue MEKINIST and withhold dabrafenib. Resume dabrafenib at the same dose upon recovery of cardiac function [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  .  \n\n\n\n     5.5 Ocular Toxicities  \n\n\n\n    Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO):    \n\n\n\n  Across all clinical trials of MEKINIST, the incidence of RVO was 0.2% (4/1,749). RVO may lead to macular edema, decreased visual function, neovascularization, and glaucoma.  \n\n\n\n  Urgently (within 24 hours) perform ophthalmological evaluation for patient-reported loss of vision or other visual disturbances. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST in patients with documented RVO. If MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib, do not modify dabrafenib dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  .  \n\n\n\n   Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachment (RPED):    \n\n\n\n  Retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED) can occur when MEKINIST is administered as a single agent or when used in combination with dabrafenib  .\n\n\n\n  In Trial 1 and Trial 2, ophthalmologic examinations including retinal evaluation were performed pretreatment and at regular intervals during treatment.  \n\n\n\n  In Trial 1, one patient (0.5%) receiving MEKINIST developed RPED and no cases of RPED were identified in chemotherapy-treated patients. Across all clinical trials of MEKINIST, the incidence of RPED was 0.8% (14/1,749). Retinal detachments were often bilateral and multifocal, occurring in the macular region of the retina. RPED led to reduction in visual acuity that resolved after a median of 11.5 days (range: 3 to 71 days) following the interruption of dosing with MEKINIST, although Ocular Coherence Tomography (OCT) abnormalities persisted beyond a month in at least several cases.  \n\n\n\n  In Trial 2, one patient (2%) receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib developed RPED.  \n\n\n\n  Perform ophthalmological evaluation at any time a patient reports visual disturbances and compare with baseline, if available. Withhold MEKINIST if RPED is diagnosed. If resolution of the RPED is documented on repeat ophthalmological evaluation within 3 weeks, resume MEKINIST at a lower dose level. Discontinue MEKINIST if no improvement after 3 weeks. If MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib, do not modify the dose of dabrafenib [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  .  \n\n\n\n   Uveitis and Iritis:    \n\n\n\n  Uveitis and iritis can occur when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib and with dabrafenib as a single agent [refer to Full Prescribing Information for dabrafenib]  .  \n\n\n\n  Uveitis occurred in 1% (2/202) of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib.  \n\n\n\n  Symptomatic treatment employed in clinical trials included steroid and mydriatic ophthalmic drops. Monitor patients for visual signs and symptoms of uveitis (e.g., change in vision, photophobia, eye pain). If diagnosed, withhold dabrafenib for up to 6 weeks until uveitis/iritis resolves to Grade 0-1. If not improved, permanently discontinue dabrafenib. If MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib, do not modify the dose of MEKINIST [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.6 Interstitial Lung Disease\n\n\n\n  In clinical trials of MEKINIST (N = 329) as a single agent, ILD or pneumonitis occurred in 2% of patients. In Trial 1, 2% (5/211) of patients treated with MEKINIST developed ILD or pneumonitis; all five patients required hospitalization. The median time to first presentation of ILD or pneumonitis was 160 days (range: 60 to 172 days).\n\n\n\n Withhold MEKINIST in patients presenting with new or progressive pulmonary symptoms and findings including cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, pleural effusion, or infiltrates, pending clinical investigations. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for patients diagnosed with treatment-related ILD or pneumonitis. If MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib, do not modify the dose of dabrafenib [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].    \n\n\n\n     5.7 Serious Febrile Reactions  \n\n\n\n   Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity accompanied by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure, can occur when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib and with dabrafenib as a single agent [refer to Full Prescribing Information for dabrafenib]  .  \n\n\n\n  The incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib compared with dabrafenib as a single agent [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .  \n\n\n\n  In Trial 2, the incidence of fever (serious and non-serious) was 71% (39/55) in patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib and 26% (14/53) in patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent. Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity accompanied by hypotension, rigors, or chills occurred in 25% (14/55) of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib compared with 2% (1/53) of patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent. Fever was complicated with chills/rigors in 51% (28/55), dehydration in 9% (5/55), renal failure in 4% (2/55), and syncope in 4% (2/55) of patients in Trial 2. In patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib, the median time to initial onset of fever was 30 days compared with 19 days in patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent; the median duration of fever was 6 days with the combination compared with 4 days with dabrafenib as a single agent.  \n\n\n\n  Across clinical trials of MEKINIST administered in combination with dabrafenib (N = 202), the incidence of pyrexia was 57% (116/202).  \n\n\n\n  Withhold dabrafenib for fever of 101.3oF or higher. Withhold MEKINIST for fever higher than 104oF. Withhold dabrafenib and MEKINIST for any serious febrile reaction or fever accompanied by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure, and evaluate for signs and symptoms of infection. Refer to Table 2 for recommended dose modifications for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  . Prophylaxis with antipyretics may be required when resuming MEKINIST or dabrafenib.  \n\n\n\n    5.8 Serious Skin Toxicity\n\n\n\n   Serious skin toxicity can occur when MEKINIST is administered as a single agent or when used in combination with dabrafenib. Serious skin toxicity can also occur with dabrafenib as a single agent [refer to Full Prescribing Information for dabrafenib]  .  \n\n\n\n In Trial 1, the overall incidence of any skin toxicity, the most common of which were rash, dermatitis acneiform rash, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, and erythema, was 87% in patients treated with MEKINIST and 13% in chemotherapy-treated patients. Severe skin toxicity occurred in 12% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Skin toxicity requiring hospitalization occurred in 6% of patients treated with MEKINIST, most commonly for secondary infections of the skin requiring intravenous antibiotics or severe skin toxicity without secondary infection. In comparison, no patients treated with chemotherapy required hospitalization for severe skin toxicity or infections of the skin. The median time to onset of skin toxicity in patients treated with MEKINIST was 15 days (range: 1 to 221 days) and median time to resolution of skin toxicity was 48 days (range: 1 to 282 days). Reductions in the dose of MEKINIST were required in 12% and permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST was required in 1% of patients with skin toxicity.\n\n\n\n  In Trial 2, the incidence of any skin toxicity was similar for patients receiving MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib (65% [36/55]) compared with patients receiving dabrafenib as a single agent (68% [36/53]). The median time to onset of skin toxicity in patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib was 37 days (range: 1 to 225 days) and median time to resolution of skin toxicity was 33 days (range: 3 to 421 days). No patient required dose reduction or permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST or dabrafenib for skin toxicity.  \n\n\n\n  Across clinical trials of MEKINIST administered in combination with dabrafenib (n = 202), severe skin toxicity and secondary infection of the skin requiring hospitalization occurred in 2.5% (5/202) of patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib.  \n\n\n\n  Withhold MEKINIST, and dabrafenib if used in combination, for intolerable or severe skin toxicity. MEKINIST and dabrafenib may be resumed at lower dose levels in patients with improvement or recovery from skin toxicity within 3 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  .  \n\n\n\n     5.9 Hyperglycemia  \n\n\n\n   Hyperglycemia can occur when MEKINIST is used in combination with dabrafenib and with dabrafenib as a single agent. Hyperglycemia requiring an increase in the dose of, or initiation of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent therapy occurred with dabrafenib as a single agent [refer to Full Prescribing Information for dabrafenib]  .  \n\n\n\n  In Trial 2, the incidence of Grade 3 hyperglycemia based on laboratory values was 5% (3/55) in patients treated with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib compared with 2% (1/53) in patients treated with dabrafenib as a single agent.  \n\n\n\n  Monitor serum glucose levels as clinically appropriate during treatment with MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib in patients with pre-existing diabetes or hyperglycemia. Advise patients to report symptoms of severe hyperglycemia.  \n\n\n\n    5.10 Embryofetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Based on its mechanism of action, MEKINIST can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. MEKINIST was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].  \n\n\n\n Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with MEKINIST and for 4 months after treatment. Advise patients to use a highly effective non-hormonal method of contraception when MEKINIST is administered in combination with dabrafenib, since dabrafenib can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective.  Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant, or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking MEKINIST [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.6)].  \n",

Discontinue CYRAMZA for severe ATEs. (  5.2  ) \n *  Hypertension: Monitor blood pressure and treat hypertension. Temporarily suspend CYRAMZA for severe hypertension. Discontinue CYRAMZA for hypertension that cannot be medically controlled. (  5.3  ) \n *  Infusion-Related Reactions: Monitor for signs and symptoms during infusion. (  5.4  ) \n *  Impaired Wound Healing: Withhold CYRAMZA prior to surgery. (  5.6  ) \n *  Clinical Deterioration in Patients with Cirrhosis: New onset or worsening encephalopathy, ascites, or hepatorenal syndrome can occur in patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis. (  5.7  ) \n *  Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome: Discontinue CYRAMZA. (  5.8  ) \n *  Proteinuria Including Nephrotic Syndrome: Monitor proteinuria. Interrupt CYRAMZA for urine protein levels >=2 g/24 hours. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA for urine protein levels >3 g/24 hours or for nephrotic syndrome. (  5.9  ) \n *  Thyroid Dysfunction: Monitor thyroid function during treatment with CYRAMZA. (  5.10  ) \n *  Embryofetal Risk: Can cause fetal harm. (  5.11  ) \n    \n \n\n      5.1 Hemorrhage\n\n\n\n     CYRAMZA increased the risk of hemorrhage and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, including severe and sometimes fatal hemorrhagic events. In Study 1, the incidence of severe bleeding was 3.4% for CYRAMZA and 2.6% for placebo. In Study 2, the incidence of severe bleeding was 4.3% for CYRAMZA plus paclitaxel and 2.4% for placebo plus paclitaxel.\n\n\n\n    Patients with gastric cancer receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were excluded from enrollment in Studies 1 and 2; therefore, the risk of gastric hemorrhage in CYRAMZA-treated patients with gastric tumors receiving NSAIDs is unknown.\n\n\n\n    In Study 3, the incidence of severe bleeding was 2.4% for CYRAMZA plus docetaxel and 2.3% for placebo plus docetaxel. Patients with NSCLC receiving therapeutic anticoagulation or chronic therapy with NSAIDS or other anti-platelet therapy other than once daily aspirin or with radiographic evidence of major airway or blood vessel invasion or intratumor cavitation were excluded from Study 3; therefore the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage in these groups of patients is unknown.\n\n\n\n    In Study 4, the incidence of severe bleeding was 2.5% for CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI and 1.7% for placebo plus FOLFIRI.\n\n\n\n    Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience severe bleeding [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Arterial Thromboembolic Events\n\n\n\n  Serious, sometimes fatal, arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) including myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular accident, and cerebral ischemia occurred in clinical trials including 1.7% of 236 patients who received CYRAMZA as a single agent for gastric cancer in Study 1. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience a severe ATE [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .\n\n\n\n       5.3 Hypertension\n\n\n\n     An increased incidence of severe hypertension occurred in patients receiving CYRAMZA as a single agent (8%) as compared to placebo (3%), in patients receiving CYRAMZA plus paclitaxel (15%) as compared to placebo plus paclitaxel (3%), in patients receiving CYRAMZA plus docetaxel (6%) as compared to placebo plus docetaxel (2%), and in patients receiving CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI (11%) as compared to placebo plus FOLFIRI (3%).\n\n\n\n Control hypertension prior to initiating treatment with CYRAMZA. Monitor blood pressure every two weeks or more frequently as indicated during treatment.\n\n\n\n Temporarily suspend CYRAMZA for severe hypertension until medically controlled. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA if medically significant hypertension cannot be controlled with antihypertensive therapy or in patients with hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4 Infusion-Related Reactions\n\n\n\n  Prior to the institution of premedication recommendations across clinical trials of CYRAMZA, IRRs occurred in 6 out of 37 patients (16%), including two severe events. The majority of IRRs across trials occurred during or following a first or second CYRAMZA infusion. Symptoms of IRRs included rigors/tremors, back pain/spasms, chest pain and/or tightness, chills, flushing, dyspnea, wheezing, hypoxia, and paresthesia. In severe cases, symptoms included bronchospasm, supraventricular tachycardia, and hypotension.\n\n\n\n Monitor patients during the infusion for signs and symptoms of IRRs in a setting with available resuscitation equipment. Immediately and permanently discontinue CYRAMZA for Grade 3 or 4 IRRs [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .\n\n\n\n       5.5 Gastrointestinal Perforations\n\n\n\n     CYRAMZA is an antiangiogenic therapy that can increase the risk of gastrointestinal perforation, a potentially fatal event. Four of 570 patients (0.7%) who received CYRAMZA as a single agent in clinical trials experienced gastrointestinal perforation. In Study 2, the incidence of gastrointestinal perforation was also increased in patients that received CYRAMZA plus paclitaxel (1.2%) as compared to patients receiving placebo plus paclitaxel (0.3%). In Study 3, the incidence of gastrointestinal perforation was 1% for CYRAMZA plus docetaxel and 0.3% for placebo plus docetaxel. In Study 4, the incidence of gastrointestinal perforation was 1.7% for CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI and 0.6% for placebo plus FOLFIRI. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience a gastrointestinal perforation [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .\n\n\n\n       5.6 Impaired Wound Healing\n\n\n\n     Impaired wound healing can occur with antibodies inhibiting the VEGF pathway. CYRAMZA has not been studied in patients with serious or non-healing wounds. CYRAMZA, an antiangiogenic therapy, has the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Discontinue CYRAMZA therapy in patients with impaired wound healing.\n\n\n\n    Withhold CYRAMZA prior to surgery. Resume following the surgical intervention based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. If a patient develops wound healing complications during therapy, discontinue CYRAMZA until the wound is fully healed [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.7 Clinical Deterioration in Patients with Child-Pugh B or C Cirrhosis\n\n\n\n  Clinical deterioration, manifested by new onset or worsening encephalopathy, ascites, or hepatorenal syndrome was reported in patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis who received single-agent CYRAMZA. Use CYRAMZA in patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis only if the potential benefits of treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of clinical deterioration.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has been reported with a rate of <0.1% in clinical studies with CYRAMZA. Confirm the diagnosis of RPLS with MRI and discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who develop RPLS. Symptoms may resolve or improve within days, although some patients with RPLS can experience ongoing neurologic sequelae or death.\n\n\n\n       5.9 Proteinuria Including Nephrotic Syndrome\n\n\n\n     In Study 4, severe proteinuria occurred more frequently in patients treated with CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI compared to patients receiving placebo plus FOLFIRI. Severe proteinuria was reported in 3% of patients treated with CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI (including 3 cases [0.6%] of nephrotic syndrome) compared to 0.2% of patients treated with placebo plus FOLFIRI.\n\n\n\n    Monitor proteinuria by urine dipstick and/or urinary protein creatinine ratio for the development of worsening of proteinuria during CYRAMZA therapy.\n\n\n\n    Withhold CYRAMZA for urine protein levels that are 2 or more grams over 24 hours. Reinitiate CYRAMZA at a reduced dose once the urine protein level returns to less than 2 grams over 24 hours. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA for urine protein levels greater than 3 grams over 24 hours or in the setting of nephrotic syndrome [see Dosage and Administration (  2.3  )].  \n\n\n\n       5.10 Thyroid Dysfunction\n\n\n\n     Monitor thyroid function during treatment with CYRAMZA. In Study 4, the incidence of hypothyroidism reported as an adverse event was 2.6% in the CYRAMZA plus FOLFIRI treated patients and 0.9% in the placebo plus FOLFIRI treated patients.\n\n\n\n       5.11 Embryofetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n     Based on its mechanism of action, CYRAMZA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Animal models link angiogenesis, VEGF and VEGF Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) to critical aspects of female reproduction, embryofetal development, and postnatal development. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CYRAMZA and for at 3 least months after the last dose of CYRAMZA [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  ,  8.3  )]  .\n",

Serious, life-threatening infections have been reported in patients taking ARCALYST. Discontinue treatment with ARCALYST if a patient develops a serious infection. Do not initiate treatment with ARCALYST in patients with active or chronic infections. (  5.1  ) \n *  Hypersensitivity reactions associated with ARCALYST administration have been rare. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue administration of ARCALYST and initiate appropriate therapy. (  5.5  ) \n *  Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with ARCALYST. Prior to initiation of therapy with ARCALYST, patients should receive all recommended vaccinations. (  5.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Infections\n\n\n\n  Interleukin -1 (IL-1) blockade may interfere with the immune response to infections. Treatment with another medication that works through inhibition of IL-1 has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, and serious infections have been reported in patients taking ARCALYST [ see Clinical Studies (  14  )  ]. There was a greater incidence of infections in patients on ARCALYST compared with placebo. In the controlled portion of the study, one infection was reported as severe, which was bronchitis in a patient on ARCALYST.\n\n\n\n In an open-label extension study, one patient developed bacterial meningitis and died [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.3  )  ]. ARCALYST should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. Treatment with ARCALYST should not be initiated in patients with an active or chronic infection.\n\n\n\n In clinical studies, ARCALYST has not been administered concomitantly with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. An increased incidence of serious infections has been associated with administration of an IL-1 blocker in combination with TNF inhibitors. Taking ARCALYST with TNF inhibitors is not recommended because this may increase the risk of serious infections.  \n\n\n\n Drugs that affect the immune system by blocking TNF have been associated with an increased risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB). It is possible that taking drugs such as ARCALYST that block IL-1 increases the risk of TB or other atypical or opportunistic infections. Healthcare providers should follow current CDC guidelines both to evaluate for and to treat possible latent tuberculosis infections before initiating therapy with ARCALYST.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Immunosuppression\n\n\n\n  The impact of treatment with ARCALYST on active and/or chronic infections and the development of malignancies is not known [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.3  )]  . However, treatment with immunosuppressants, including ARCALYST, may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Immunizations\n\n\n\n  Since no data are available on either the efficacy of live vaccines or on the risks of secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving ARCALYST, live vaccines should not be given concurrently with ARCALYST. In addition, because ARCALYST may interfere with normal immune response to new antigens, vaccinations may not be effective in patients receiving ARCALYST. No data are available on the effectiveness of vaccination with inactivated (killed) antigens in patients receiving ARCALYST.\n\n\n\n Because IL-1 blockade may interfere with immune response to infections, it is recommended that prior to initiation of therapy with ARCALYST adult and pediatric patients receive all recommended vaccinations, as appropriate, including pneumococcal vaccine and inactivated influenza vaccine. (See current Recommended Immunizations schedules at the website of the Centers for Disease Control. http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/).\n\n\n\n    5.4 Lipid Profile Changes\n\n\n\n  Patients should be monitored for changes in their lipid profiles and provided with medical treatment if warranted [see Adverse Reactions (  6.7  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Hypersensitivity\n\n\n\n  Hypersensitivity reactions associated with ARCALYST administration in the clinical studies were rare. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of ARCALYST should be discontinued and appropriate therapy initiated.\n",

(  5.1  ) \n *  Neuropsychiatric events: Patients with influenza may be at an increased risk of hallucinations, delirium and abnormal behavior early in their illness. Monitor for signs of abnormal behavior. (  5.2  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Rare cases of serious skin reactions, including erythema multiforme, have been reported with RAPIVAB in clinical studies and in postmarketing experience; Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been reported with RAPIVAB in postmarketing experience. Appropriate treatment should be instituted if a serious skin reaction occurs or is suspected.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Neuropsychiatric Events\n\n\n\n  Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioral symptoms that can include events such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behavior, in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur in uncomplicated influenza as well.\n\n\n\n There have been postmarketing reports (from Japan) of delirium and abnormal behavior leading to injury in patients with influenza who were receiving neuraminidase inhibitors, including RAPIVAB. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made, but they appear to be uncommon. These events were reported primarily among pediatric patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of RAPIVAB to these events has not been established. Patients with influenza should be closely monitored for signs of abnormal behavior.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Risk of Bacterial Infections\n\n\n\n  There is no evidence for efficacy of RAPIVAB in any illness caused by agents other than influenza viruses. Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza. RAPIVAB has not been shown to prevent such complications.\n\n\n\n Prescribers should be alert to the potential for secondary bacterial infections and treat with antibiotics as appropriate.\n",

(  2.2  ,  5.1  ) \n *  Mucositis: Monitor at least weekly. If >= Grade 2 mucositis is observed, omit and/or reduce dose. (  2.2  ,  5.2  ) \n *  Dermatologic reactions: Reactions, including fatal reactions, have occurred and may be progressive and increase in severity with further treatment. Monitor closely, and omit and/or reduce dose or discontinue FOLOTYN. (  2.2  ,  5.3  ) \n *  Tumor lysis syndrome: Anticipate, monitor, and treat promptly. (  5.4  ) \n *  Hepatic toxicity: Monitor for toxicity. For liver function test abnormalities Grade 3 or greater, omit until recovery then reduce dose or discontinue therapy as required. (  2.2  ,  5.5  ) \n *  Risk of increased toxicity with renal impairment: Patients with moderate to severe renal function impairment may be at greater risk for increased exposure and toxicity. Monitor patients for renal function and systemic toxicity and adjust dosing accordingly. Avoid FOLOTYN use in patients with end stage renal disease including those undergoing dialysis unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. (  2.2  ,  5.6  ,  6.2  ) \n *  Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Women should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with FOLOTYN. Inform pregnant women of the potential harm to the fetus. (  5.7  ,  8.1  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Bone Marrow Suppression\n\n\n\n  FOLOTYN can cause bone marrow suppression, manifested by thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and/or anemia. Monitor complete blood counts and omit and/or reduce the dose based on ANC and platelet count prior to each dose as outlined in Section  2.2     Table 2  . Administer vitamin B12and instruct patients to take folic acid to reduce the risk of treatment-related hematological toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )(  2.2  ) and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.2 Mucositis\n\n\n\n  FOLOTYN can cause mucositis. Monitor for mucositis weekly and if >= Grade 2 mucositis is observed, omit and/or reduce the dose as outlined in Section  2.2     Table 1  . Administer vitamin B12and instruct patients to take folic acid to reduce the risk of mucositis [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )(2.2  ) and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.3 Dermatologic Reactions\n\n\n\n  FOLOTYN can cause severe dermatologic reactions, which may result in death. These dermatologic reactions have been reported in clinical studies (14/663 patients [2.1%]) and post marketing experience, and have included skin exfoliation, ulceration, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).  They may be progressive and increase in severity with further treatment, and may involve skin and subcutaneous sites of known lymphoma.  Monitor patients with dermatologic reactions closely, and if severe, withhold or discontinue FOLOTYN [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.2  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.7  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome\n\n\n\n  FOLOTYN can cause tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Monitor patients who are at increased risk of TLS and treat promptly.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Hepatic Toxicity\n\n\n\n  FOLOTYN can cause hepatic toxicity and liver function test abnormalities. Persistent liver function test abnormalities may be indicators of hepatic toxicity and require dose modification or discontinuation. Monitor liver function tests. Omit dose until recovery, adjust or discontinue therapy based on the severity of the hepatic toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ) and Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )  ].\n\n\n\n       5.6 Risk of Increased Toxicity in the Presence of Impaired Renal Function\n\n\n\n     Patients with moderate to severe renal function impairment may be at greater risk for increased exposure and toxicity. Monitor patients for renal function and systemic toxicity and adjust dosing accordingly.\n\n\n\n    Serious adverse drug reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis and mucositis were reported in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing dialysis who were administered FOLOTYN therapy. Avoid FOLOTYN use in patients with end stage renal disease including those undergoing dialysis unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  ), Adverse Reactions (  6.2  ), Use in Specific Populations (  8.7  ), and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  FOLOTYN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. FOLOTYN was embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rats and rabbits. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )  ].\n",

(  5.1  ) \n *   Infusion Reactions  : Infusion reactions occurred in patients treated with KRYSTEXXA. Pre-medicate and monitor patients.  (  5.2  ) \n *   Gout Flares : Gout flare prophylaxis is recommended for at least the first 6 months of KRYSTEXXA therapy. (  5.3  ) \n *   Congestive Heart Failure : Congestive heart failure exacerbation may occur. Monitor patients closely following infusion. (  5.4  ) \n    \n \n\n    5.1   Anaphylaxis  \n\n\n\n  During pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, anaphylaxis was reported with a frequency of 6.5% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA every 2 weeks, compared to none with placebo. Manifestations included wheezing, peri-oral or lingual edema, or hemodynamic instability, with or without rash or urticaria. Cases occurred in patients being pre-treated with one or more doses of an oral antihistamine, an intravenous corticosteroid and/or acetaminophen. This pre-treatment may have blunted or obscured symptoms or signs of anaphylaxis and therefore the reported frequency may be an underestimate. [ See   Adverse Reactions      (  6  )]\n\n\n\n KRYSTEXXA should be administered in a healthcare setting by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis. Patients should be pre-treated with antihistamines and corticosteroids. Anaphylaxis may occur with any infusion, including a first infusion, and generally manifests within 2 hours of the infusion. However, delayed type hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported. Patients should be closely monitored for an appropriate period of time for anaphylaxis after administration of KRYSTEXXA. Patients should be informed of the symptoms and signs of anaphylaxis and instructed to seek immediate medical care should anaphylaxis occur after discharge from the healthcare setting.\n\n\n\n The risk of anaphylaxis is higher in patients whose uric acid level increases to above 6 mg/dL, particularly when 2 consecutive levels above 6 mg/dL are observed. Monitor serum uric acid levels prior to infusions and consider discontinuing treatment if levels increase to above 6 mg/dL. Because of the possibility that concomitant use of oral urate-lowering therapy and KRYSTEXXA may potentially blunt the rise of serum uric acid levels, it is recommended that before starting KRYSTEXXA patients discontinue oral urate-lowering medications and not institute therapy with oral urate-lowering agents while taking KRYSTEXXA.\n\n\n\n     5.2   Infusion Reactions  \n\n\n\n  During pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, infusion reactions were reported in 26% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks, and 41% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 4 weeks, compared to 5% of patients treated with placebo. These infusion reactions occurred in patients being pre-treated with an oral antihistamine, intravenous corticosteroid and/or acetaminophen. This pre-treatment may have blunted or obscured symptoms or signs of infusion reactions and therefore the reported frequency may be an underestimate. [ See       Adverse Reactions      (  6  )]\n\n\n\n KRYSTEXXA should be administered in a healthcare setting by healthcare providers prepared to manage infusion reactions. Patients should be pre-treated with antihistamines and corticosteroids. KRYSTEXXA should be infused slowly over no less than 120 minutes. In the event of an infusion reaction, the infusion should be slowed, or stopped and restarted at a slower rate.\n\n\n\n The risk of infusion reaction is higher in patients whose uric acid level increases to above 6 mg/dL, particularly when 2 consecutive levels above 6 mg/dL are observed. Monitor serum uric acid levels prior to infusions and consider discontinuing treatment if levels increase to above 6 mg/dL. Because of the possibility that concomitant use of oral urate-lowering therapy and KRYSTEXXA may potentially blunt the rise of serum uric acid levels, it is recommended that before starting KRYSTEXXA patients discontinue oral urate-lowering medications and not institute therapy with oral urate-lowering agents while taking KRYSTEXXA.\n\n\n\n     5.   3   Gout Flares  \n\n\n\n  Gout flares may occur after initiation of KRYSTEXXA. [ see   Adverse Reactions      (  6.1  )]  An increase in gout flares is frequently observed upon initiation of anti-hyperuricemic therapy, due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Gout flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended starting at least 1 week before initiation of KRYSTEXXA therapy and lasting at least 6 months, unless medically contraindicated or not tolerated.                KRYSTEXXA does not need to be discontinued because of a gout flare. The gout flare should be managed concurrently as appropriate for the individual patient. [ see   Dosage and Administration  (  2  )] \n\n\n\n     5.   4       Congestive Heart Failure  \n\n\n\n  KRYSTEXXA has not been formally studied in patients with congestive heart failure, but some patients in the clinical trials experienced exacerbation. [ see   Adverse Reactions      (  6.1  )] Exercise caution when using KRYSTEXXA in patients who have congestive heart failure and monitor patients closely following infusion.\n\n\n\n     5.   5   Re-treatment with KRYSTEXXA  \n\n\n\n  No controlled trial data are available on the safety and efficacy of re-treatment with KRYSTEXXA after stopping treatment for longer than 4 weeks.           Due to the immunogenicity of KRYSTEXXA, patients receiving re-treatment may be at increased risk of anaphylaxis and infusion reactions. Therefore, patients receiving re-treatment after a drug-free interval should be monitored carefully. [ see   Adverse Reactions  (  6.2  )]\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Misuse, Abuse and Diversion: NUCYNTA  (r)  is a Schedule II controlled substance with abuse liability similar to other opioids: monitor patients closely for signs of misuse, abuse and addiction. (  5.1  ) \n *  Elderly, cachectic, and debilitated patients and patients with chronic pulmonary disease: Monitor closely because of increased risk of respiratory depression. (  5.5  ) \n *  Interaction with CNS depressants including other opioids, sedatives, alcohol, and illicit drugs: Consider dose reduction of one or both drugs because of additive effects. (  5.7  ) \n *  Hypotensive effect: Monitor for signs of hypotension.(  5.8  ) \n *  Patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of NUCYNTA  (r)  in patients with impaired consciousness or coma susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2retention. (  5.9  ) \n *  Seizures: Use with caution in patients with a history of seizures. (  5.10  ) \n *  Serotonin Syndrome: Potentially life-threatening condition could result from concomitant serotonergic administration. (  5.11  ) \n *  Withdrawal: Withdrawal symptoms may occur if NUCYNTA  (r)  is discontinued abruptly. (  5.13  ) \n *  Impaired mental/physical abilities: Caution must be used with potentially hazardous activities. (  5.14  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Abuse Potential\n\n\n\n   NUCYNTA  (r)  contains tapentadol, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. Tapentadol can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists legal or illicit. Opioid agonists are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing NUCYNTA  (r)  in situations where there is concern about increased risks of misuse, abuse, or diversion. Concerns about abuse, addiction, and diversion should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain.  \n\n\n\n  Assess each patient's risk for opioid abuse or addiction prior to prescribing NUCYNTA  (r)  . The risk for opioid abuse is increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Patients at increased risk may still be appropriately treated with opioids; however these patients will require intensive monitoring for signs of misuse, abuse, or addiction. Routinely monitor all patients receiving opioids for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction because these drugs carry a risk for addiction even under appropriate medical use.  \n\n\n\n Misuse or abuse of NUCYNTA  (r)  by crushing, chewing, snorting or injecting will pose a significant risk that could result in overdose and death [see  Overdosage (10)  ].  \n\n\n\n Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product [see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Life Threatening Respiratory Depression\n\n\n\n   Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including NUCYNTA  (r)  . Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with a \"sighing\" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see  Overdosage (10)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n  Instruct patients against use by individuals other than the patient for whom NUCYNTA  (r)  was prescribed and to keep NUCYNTA  (r)  out of the reach of children, as such inappropriate use may result in fatal respiratory depression.  \n\n\n\n  Patients with conditions accompanied by hypoxia, hypercarbia or decreased respiratory reserve such as: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, central nervous system (CNS) depression, or coma may be at increased risk for increased airway resistance and decreased respiratory drive to the point of apnea even with usual therapeutic doses of NUCYNTA  (r)  . Consider the use of alternative non-mu-opioid agonist analgesics and use NUCYNTA  (r)  only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose in such patients. If respiratory depression occurs, treat the patient for mu-opioid agonist-induced respiratory depression [see  Overdosage (10.2)  ]  . To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing of NUCYNTA  (r)  is essential [see  Dosage and Administration (2)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Accidental Exposure\n\n\n\n   Accidental ingestion of NUCYNTA  (r)  , especially in children, can result in a fatal overdose of tapentadol.  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Interactions with Alcohol, Other Opioids, and Drugs of Abuse\n\n\n\n   Due to its mu-opioid agonist activity, NUCYNTA  (r)  may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol, other opioids, or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression, respiratory depression, hypotension, and profound sedation, coma or death [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ]  . Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol, other opioids, or drugs of abuse while on NUCYNTA  (r)  therapy [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.5 Elderly, Cachectic, and Debilitated Patients\n\n\n\n   Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Therefore, closely monitor such patients, particularly when NUCYNTA  (r)  is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.6 Use in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease\n\n\n\n   Monitor for respiratory depression those patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercarbia, or pre-existing respiratory depression, as in these patients, even usual therapeutic doses of NUCYNTA  (r)  may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ].  Consider the use of alternative non-opioid analgesics in these patients if possible.  \n\n\n\n    5.7 Interactions with CNS Depressants and Illicit Drugs\n\n\n\n  Hypotension, and profound sedation, coma or respiratory depression may result if NUCYNTA  (r)  is used concomitantly with other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, anxiolytics, hypnotics, neuroleptics, muscle relaxants, other opioids and illicit drugs). When considering the use of NUCYNTA  (r)  in a patient taking a CNS depressant, assess the duration of use of the CNS depressant and the patient's response, including the degree of tolerance that has developed to CNS depression. Additionally, consider the patient's use, if any, of alcohol and/or illicit drugs that can cause CNS depression. If NUCYNTA  (r)  therapy is to be initiated in a patient taking a CNS depressant, start with a lower NUCYNTA  (r)  dose than usual and monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression and consider using a lower dose of the concomitant CNS depressant [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.8 Hypotensive Effect\n\n\n\n   NUCYNTA  (r)  may cause severe hypotension. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ]  . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after the dose of NUCYNTA  (r)  . In patients with circulatory shock, NUCYNTA  (r)  may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of NUCYNTA  (r)  in patients with circulatory shock.  \n\n\n\n    5.9 Use in Patients with Head Injury or Increased Intracranial Pressure\n\n\n\n   Monitor patients taking NUCYNTA  (r)  who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors) for signs of sedation and respiratory depression. NUCYNTA  (r)  may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury.  \n\n\n\n Avoid the use of NUCYNTA  (r)  in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.\n\n\n\n    5.10 Seizures\n\n\n\n   NUCYNTA  (r)  has not been evaluated in patients with a predisposition to a seizure disorder, and such patients were excluded from clinical studies. The active ingredient tapentadol in NUCYNTA  (r)  may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during NUCYNTA  (r)  therapy.  \n\n\n\n    5.11 Serotonin Syndrome Risk\n\n\n\n   Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported with the concurrent use of tapentadol and serotonergic drugs. Serotonergic drugs comprise Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g. mirtazapine, trazodone, and tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs). This may occur within the recommended dose. Serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and can be fatal [see  Drug Interactions (7.4)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.12 Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions\n\n\n\n  NUCYNTA  (r)  is contraindicated in patients with GI obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The tapentadol in NUCYNTA  (r)  may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.\n\n\n\n    5.13 Withdrawal\n\n\n\n  Withdrawal symptoms may occur if NUCYNTA  (r)  is discontinued abruptly. These symptoms may include: anxiety, sweating, insomnia, rigors, pain, nausea, tremors, diarrhea, upper respiratory symptoms, piloerection, and rarely, hallucinations. Withdrawal symptoms may be reduced by tapering NUCYNTA  (r)   [see  Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.14 Driving and Operating Heavy Machinery\n\n\n\n   NUCYNTA  (r)  may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of NUCYNTA  (r)  and know how they will react to the medication.  \n\n\n\n    5.15 Hepatic Impairment\n\n\n\n  A study with NUCYNTA  (r)  in subjects with hepatic impairment showed higher serum concentrations of tapentadol than in those with normal hepatic function. Avoid use of NUCYNTA  (r)  in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Reduce the dose of NUCYNTA  (r)  in patients with moderate hepatic impairment [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . Closely monitor patients with moderate hepatic impairment for respiratory and central nervous system depression when receiving NUCYNTA  (r)  .\n\n\n\n    5.16 Renal Impairment\n\n\n\n   Use of NUCYNTA  (r)  in patients with severe renal impairment is not recommended due to accumulation of a metabolite formed by glucuronidation of tapentadol. The clinical relevance of the elevated metabolite is not known [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .  \n",

If a serious infection develops, interrupt ACTEMRA until the infection is controlled. (  5.1  ) \n *  Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation - use with caution in patients who may be at increased risk. (  5.2  ) \n *  Laboratory monitoring - recommended due to potential consequences of treatment-related changes in neutrophils, platelets, lipids, and liver function tests. (  2.7  ,  5.3  ) \n *  Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and death have occurred. (  5.5  ) \n *  Live vaccines - Avoid use with ACTEMRA. (  5.8  ,  7.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Serious Infections\n\n\n\n  Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, protozoal, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including ACTEMRA for rheumatoid arthritis. The most common serious infections included pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis and bacterial arthritis [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, cryptococcus, aspergillosis, candidiasis, and pneumocystosis were reported with ACTEMRA. Other serious infections, not reported in clinical studies, may also occur (e.g., histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, listeriosis). Patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease, and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids which in addition to rheumatoid arthritis may predispose them to infections.\n\n\n\n Do not administer ACTEMRA in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating ACTEMRA in patients:\n\n\n\n *  with chronic or recurrent infection; \n *  who have been exposed to tuberculosis; \n *  with a history of serious or an opportunistic infection; \n *  who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or \n *  with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. \n    Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with ACTEMRA, as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened due to suppression of the acute phase reactants [see  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  ,  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  , and  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ]  .\n \n\n Hold ACTEMRA if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with ACTEMRA should undergo a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and closely monitor the patient.\n\n\n\n    Tuberculosis  \n\n\n\n Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating ACTEMRA.\n\n\n\n Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of ACTEMRA in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.\n\n\n\n Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis including patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy.\n\n\n\n It is recommended that patients be screened for latent tuberculosis infection prior to starting ACTEMRA. The incidence of tuberculosis in worldwide clinical development programs is 0.1%. Patients with latent tuberculosis should be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating ACTEMRA.\n\n\n\n    Viral Reactivation  \n\n\n\n Viral reactivation has been reported with immunosuppressive biologic therapies and cases of herpes zoster exacerbation were observed in clinical studies with ACTEMRA. No cases of Hepatitis B reactivation were observed in the trials; however patients who screened positive for hepatitis were excluded.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Gastrointestinal Perforations\n\n\n\n  Events of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in clinical trials, primarily as complications of diverticulitis in RA patients. Use ACTEMRA with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation. Promptly evaluate patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.3 Laboratory Parameters\n\n\n\n   Rheumatoid Arthritis  \n\n\n\n    Neutropenia  \n\n\n\n Treatment with ACTEMRA was associated with a higher incidence of neutropenia. Infections have been uncommonly reported in association with treatment-related neutropenia in long-term extension studies and postmarketing clinical experience.\n\n\n\n *  -  It is not recommended to initiate ACTEMRA treatment in patients with a low neutrophil count, i.e., absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 2000 per mm  3  . In patients who develop an absolute neutrophil count less than 500 per mm  3  treatment is not recommended. \n *  -   Monitor neutrophils 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ] . For recommended modifications based on ANC results see [  Dosage and Administration (2.7)  ] .  \n       Thrombocytopenia  \n \n\n Treatment with ACTEMRA was associated with a reduction in platelet counts. Treatment-related reduction in platelets was not associated with serious bleeding events in clinical trials [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1  ,  6.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n *  -  It is not recommended to initiate ACTEMRA treatment in patients with a platelet count below 100,000 per mm  3  . In patients who develop a platelet count less than 50,000 per mm  3  treatment is not recommended. \n *  -   Monitor platelets 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on platelet counts see [  Dosage and Administration (2.7)  ] .  \n       Elevated Liver Enzymes  \n \n\n Treatment with ACTEMRA was associated with a higher incidence of transaminase elevations. These elevations did not result in apparent permanent or clinically evident hepatic injury in clinical trials [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1  ,  6.2)  ]  . Increased frequency and magnitude of these elevations was observed when potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g., MTX) were used in combination with ACTEMRA.\n\n\n\n In one case, a patient who had received ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg monotherapy without elevations in transaminases experienced elevation in AST to above 10* ULN and elevation in ALT to above 16* ULN when MTX was initiated in combination with ACTEMRA. Transaminases normalized when both treatments were held, but elevations recurred when MTX and ACTEMRA were restarted at lower doses. Elevations resolved when MTX and ACTEMRA were discontinued.\n\n\n\n *  -  It is not recommended to initiate ACTEMRA treatment in patients with elevated transaminases ALT or AST greater than 1.5* ULN. In patients who develop elevated ALT or AST greater than 5* ULN treatment is not recommended. \n *  -   Monitor ALT and AST levels 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter. When clinically indicated, other liver function tests such as bilirubin should be considered. For recommended modifications based on transaminases see [  Dosage and Administration (2.7)  ] .  \n        Lipid Abnormalities    \n \n\n Treatment with ACTEMRA was associated with increases in lipid parameters such as total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and/or HDL cholesterol [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1  ,  6.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n *  -  Assess lipid parameters approximately 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of ACTEMRA therapy, then at approximately 24 week intervals. \n *  -  Manage patients according to clinical guidelines [e.g., National Cholesterol Educational Program (NCEP)] for the management of hyperlipidemia. \n       Polyarticular and Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis  \n \n\n A similar pattern of liver enzyme elevation, low neutrophil count, low platelet count and lipid elevations is noted with ACTEMRA treatment in the PJIA and SJIA populations. Monitor neutrophils, platelets, ALT and AST at the time of the second infusion and thereafter every 4 to 8 weeks for PJIA and every 2 to 4 weeks for SJIA. Monitor lipids as above for RA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.7)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4 Immunosuppression\n\n\n\n  The impact of treatment with ACTEMRA on the development of malignancies is not known but malignancies were observed in clinical studies [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . ACTEMRA is an immunosuppressant, and treatment with immunosuppressants may result in an increased risk of malignancies.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis\n\n\n\n   Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in association with ACTEMRA [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  and anaphylactic events with a fatal outcome have been reported with intravenous infusion of ACTEMRA. Anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation were reported in 0.1% (3 out of 2644) of patients in the 6-month controlled trials of intravenous ACTEMRA, 0.2% (8 out of 4009) of patients in the intravenous all-exposure RA population, 0.7% (8 out of 1068) in the subcutaneous 6-month controlled RA trials, and in 0.7% (10 out of 1465) of patients in the subcutaneous all-exposure population. In the SJIA controlled trial with intravenous ACTEMRA, 1 out of 112 patients (0.9%) experienced hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation. In the PJIA controlled trial with intravenous ACTEMRA, 0 out of 188 patients (0%) in the ACTEMRA all-exposure population experienced hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation. Reactions that required treatment discontinuation included generalized erythema, rash, and uticaria. Injection site reactions were categorized separately [s ee  Adverse Reactions (6)    ].  \n\n\n\n  In the postmarketing setting, events of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and death have occurred in patients treated with a range of doses of intravenous ACTEMRA, with or without concomitant arthritis therapies.  Events have occurred in patients who received premedication. Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis events, have occurred both with and without previous hypersensitivity reactions and as early as the first infusion of ACTEMRA [see  Adverse Reactions (6.5)  ]  . ACTEMRA for intravenous use should only be infused by a healthcare professional with appropriate medical support to manage anaphylaxis. For ACTEMRA subcutaneous injection, advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reaction occurs, stop administration of ACTEMRA immediately and discontinue ACTEMRA permanently. Do not administer ACTEMRA to patients with known hypersensitivity to ACTEMRA [see  Contraindications (4)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.6 Demyelinating Disorders\n\n\n\n  The impact of treatment with ACTEMRA on demyelinating disorders is not known, but multiple sclerosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy were reported rarely in RA clinical studies. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms potentially indicative of demyelinating disorders. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of ACTEMRA in patients with preexisting or recent onset demyelinating disorders.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Active Hepatic Disease and Hepatic Impairment\n\n\n\n  Treatment with ACTEMRA is not recommended in patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ,  Use in Specific Populations (8.6)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.8 Vaccinations\n\n\n\n  Avoid use of live vaccines concurrently with ACTEMRA as clinical safety has not been established. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving ACTEMRA.\n\n\n\n No data are available on the effectiveness of vaccination in patients receiving ACTEMRA. Because IL-6 inhibition may interfere with the normal immune response to new antigens, it is recommended that all patients, particularly PJIA and SJIA patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating ACTEMRA therapy. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of ACTEMRA therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents.\n",

If it occurs, discontinue VIIBRYD and initiate supportive treatment (  5.2  ) \n *  Increased Risk of Bleeding: Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may increase this risk (  5.3  ) \n *  Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Screen patients for bipolar disorder (  5.4  ). \n *  Seizures: Can occur with treatment. Use with caution in patients with a seizure disorder (  5.6  ). \n *  Angle Closure Glaucoma: Avoid use of antidepressants, including VIIBRYD, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles. (  5.7  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults\n\n\n\n  In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients, and over 4,400 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in patients age 24 years and younger was greater in antidepressant-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in  Table 1  .\n\n\n\n No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric studies. There were suicides in the adult studies, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about antidepressant drug effect on suicide.\n\n\n\n Table 1: Risk Differences of the Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Patients \n  Age Range (years)     Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors per 1000 Patients Treated     \n                      Increases Compared to Placebo                                                      \n <18                 14 additional patients                                                              \n 18-24               5 additional patients                                                               \n                      Decreases Compared to Placebo                                                      \n 25-64               1 fewer patient                                                                     \n >=65                6 fewer patients                                                                    \n        It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance studies in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression.\n \n\n Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing VIIBRYD, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.\n\n\n\n       5.2 Serotonin Syndrome\n\n\n\n     SNRIs and SSRIs, including VIIBRYD, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs [see Contraindications (  4  ) and Drug Interactions (  7  )].  Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome were noted in 0.1% of MDD patients treated with VIIBRYD in premarketing clinical trials.\n\n\n\n    Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).\n\n\n\n    The concomitant use of VIIBRYD with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate VIIBRYD in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking VIIBRYD, discontinue VIIBRYD before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (  4  ), Drug Interactions (  7.1  )].  \n\n\n\n    Monitor all patients taking VIIBRYD for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with VIIBRYD and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of VIIBRYD with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Increased Risk of Bleeding\n\n\n\n  Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including VIIBRYD, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.\n\n\n\n Inform patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of VIIBRYD and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating, titrating, or discontinuing VIIBRYD.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Activation of Mania or Hypomania\n\n\n\n  In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with VIIBRYD or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In controlled clinical trials, patients with bipolar disorder were excluded; however, symptoms of mania or hypomania were reported in 0.1% of undiagnosed patients treated with VIIBRYD. Prior to initiating treatment with VIIBRYD, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Discontinuation Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.6 Seizures\n\n\n\n  VIIBRYD has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. Patients with a history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. VIIBRYD should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder.\n\n\n\n       5.7 Angle-Closure Glaucoma\n\n\n\n     The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including VIIBRYD may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including VIIBRYD, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Hyponatremia\n\n\n\n  Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including VIIBRYD. Cases of serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).\n\n\n\n In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue VIIBRYD and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.5  )]  .\n",

(  6.1  ).\n\n\n\n   To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America LLC at 1-800-321-4576 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\n\n  Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n\n\n\n In three Phase 3 clinical trials, 616 subjects were exposed to LUZU Cream, 1%: 305 with interdigital tinea pedis and 311 subjects with tinea cruris. Subjects with interdigital tinea pedis or tinea cruris applied LUZU Cream, 1% or vehicle cream once daily for 14 days or 7 days, respectively, to affected and adjacent areas. During clinical trials with LUZU Cream, 1%, the most common adverse reactions were application site reactions which occurred in less than 1% of subjects in both the LUZU and vehicle arms. Most adverse reactions were mild in severity.\n\n\n\n   6.2 Post-Marketing Experience\n\n  The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of luliconazole cream, 1%: contact dermatitis and cellulitis. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n",

Always have resuscitation equipment and trained personnel readily available (  5.1  ) \n *  Anaphylactoid reactions (  5.2  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1  Cardiopulmonary Reactions\n\n\n\n  Serious cardiopulmonary reactions, including fatalities have occurred uncommonly during or shortly following administration of ultrasound contrast agents, including Lumason. These reactions typically occurred within 30 minutes of administration. The risk for these reactions may be increased among patients with unstable cardiopulmonary conditions (acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary artery syndromes, worsening or unstable congestive heart failure, or serious ventricular arrhythmias). Always have cardiopulmonary resuscitation personnel and equipment readily available prior to Lumason administration and monitor all patients for acute reactions.\n\n\n\n The reported reactions that may follow the administration of ultrasound contrast agents include: fatal cardiac or respiratory arrest, shock, syncope, symptomatic arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, bradycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia), hypertension, hypotension, dyspnea, hypoxia, chest pain, respiratory distress, stridor, wheezing, loss of consciousness, and convulsions.\n\n\n\n    5.2  Anaphylactoid Reactions\n\n\n\n  Anaphylactoid reactions such as skin erythema, rash, urticaria, flushing, throat tightness, dyspnea, or anaphylactic shock have uncommonly been observed following the injection of Lumason. These reactions may occur in patients with no history of prior exposure to sulfur hexafluoride lipid containing microspheres.\n\n\n\n    5.3  Systemic Embolization\n\n\n\n  In patients with right-to-left, bi-directional, or transient right-to-left cardiac shunts, some intravenously injected sulfur hexafluoride lipid containing microspheres may bypass filtering by the lung and directly enter the arterial circulation. Occlusion of the microcirculation by these microspheres may result in tissue ischemia. Lumason is only for intravenous administration; do not administer Lumason by intra-arterial injection.\n\n\n\n    5.4  High Mechanical Index\n\n\n\n  High ultrasound mechanical index values may cause microsphere cavitation or rupture and lead to ventricular arrhythmias. Additionally, end-systolic triggering with high mechanical indices has been reported to cause ventricular arrhythmias.\n",

Monitor patients for hematological toxicity at baseline and monthly thereafter. Discontinue if MDS/AML is confirmed. (  5.1  ) \n *    Pneumonitis: occurred in patients exposed to Lynparza, and some cases were fatal. Interrupt treatment if pneumonitis is suspected. Discontinue if pneumonitis is confirmed. (  5.2  ) \n *    Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Lynparza can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy. (  5.3  ,  8.1  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n\n\n\n  Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML) have been confirmed in 6 out of 298 (2%) patients enrolled in a single arm trial of Lynparza monotherapy, in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA  -mutated ( gBRCA  m) advanced cancers. In a randomized placebo controlled trial, MDS/AML occurred in 3 out of 136 (2%) patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with Lynparza. Overall, MDS/AML were reported in 22 of 2,618 (<1%) patients treated with Lynparza. The majority of MDS/AML cases (17 of 22 cases) were fatal, and the duration of therapy with Lynparza in patients who developed secondary MDS/cancer-therapy related AML varied from <6 months to >2 years. All patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA damaging agents.\n\n\n\n Monitor complete blood count testing at baseline and monthly thereafter. Do not start Lynparza until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (<=CTCAE Grade 1). For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt Lynparza and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. If the levels have not recovered to CTCAE Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. If MDS/AML is confirmed, discontinue Lynparza.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Pneumonitis\n\n\n\n  Pneumonitis, including fatal cases, occurred in <1% of patients treated with Lynparza. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, fever, cough, wheezing, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt treatment with Lynparza and initiate prompt investigation. If pneumonitis is confirmed, discontinue Lynparza.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Lynparza can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals. Olaparib was teratogenic and caused embryo-fetal toxicity in rats at exposures below those in patients receiving the recommended human dose of 400 mg twice daily. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus [see     Use in Specific Populations (8.1)     ]  .\n\n\n\n Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant while taking Lynparza. If contraceptive methods are being considered, use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after receiving the last dose of Lynparza [see     Use in Specific Populations (8.6)     ]  .\n",

(  5.1  ) \n *  Elevated IGF-1: Monitor regularly in all patients. Consider discontinuation in patients with persistent elevations. (  5.2  ) \n *  Fluid retention: May include edema, arthralgia, and carpal tunnel syndrome. (  5.3  ) \n *  Glucose intolerance: May develop with EGRIFTA  (r)  use. Evaluate glucose status prior to and during therapy with EGRIFTA  (r)  . (  5.4  ) \n *  Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, urticaria): Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if suspected. (  5.5  ) \n *  Injection site reactions: Advise patients to rotate sites. (  5.6  ) \n *  Acute critical illness: Consider discontinuation. (  5.7  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Neoplasms\n\n\n\n  EGRIFTA  (r)  induces the release of endogenous growth hormone (GH), a known growth factor. Thus, patients with active malignancy should not be treated with EGRIFTA  (r)   [see Contraindications (  4.2  )]  .\n\n\n\n For patients with a history of non-malignant neoplasms, EGRIFTA  (r)  therapy should be initiated after careful evaluation of the potential benefit of treatment. For patients with a history of treated and stable malignancies, EGRIFTA  (r)  therapy should be initiated only after careful evaluation of the potential benefit of treatment relative to the risk of re-activation of the underlying malignancy.\n\n\n\n In addition, the decision to start treatment with EGRIFTA  (r)  should be considered carefully based on the increased background risk of malignancies in HIV-positive patients.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Elevated IGF-1\n\n\n\n  EGRIFTA  (r)  stimulates GH production and increases serum IGF-1. Given that IGF-1 is a growth factor and the effect of prolonged elevations in IGF-1 levels on the development or progression of malignancies is unknown, IGF-1 levels should be monitored closely during EGRIFTA  (r)  therapy. Careful consideration should be given to discontinuing EGRIFTA  (r)  in patients with persistent elevations of IGF-1 levels (e.g., >3 SDS), particularly if the efficacy response is not robust (e.g., based on visceral adipose tissue changes measured by waist circumference or CT scan).\n\n\n\n During the clinical trials, patients were monitored every three months. Among patients who received EGRIFTA  (r)  for 26 weeks, 47.4% had IGF-1 levels greater than 2 standard deviation scores (SDS), and 35.6% had SDS >3, with this effect seen as early as 13 weeks of treatment. Among those patients who remained on EGRIFTA  (r)  for a total of 52 weeks, at the end of treatment 33.7% had IGF-1 SDS >2 and 22.6% had IGF-1 SDS >3.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Fluid Retention\n\n\n\n  Fluid retention may occur during EGRIFTA  (r)  therapy and is thought to be related to the induction of GH secretion. It manifests as increased tissue turgor and musculoskeletal discomfort resulting in a variety of adverse reactions (e.g. edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome) which are either transient or resolve with discontinuation of treatment.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Glucose Intolerance\n\n\n\n  EGRIFTA  (r)  treatment may result in glucose intolerance. During the Phase 3 clinical trials, the percentages of patients with elevated HbA1c(>= 6.5%) from baseline to Week 26 were 4.5% and 1.3% in the EGRIFTA  (r)  and placebo groups, respectively. An increased risk of developing diabetes with EGRIFTA  (r)  (HbA1clevel >= 6.5%) relative to placebo was observed [intent-to-treat hazard odds ratio of 3.3 (CI 1.4, 9.6)]. Therefore, glucose status should be carefully evaluated prior to initiating EGRIFTA  (r)  treatment. In addition, all patients treated with EGRIFTA  (r)  should be monitored periodically for changes in glucose metabolism to diagnose those who develop impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. Diabetes is a known cardiovascular risk factor and patients who develop glucose intolerance have an elevated risk for developing diabetes. Caution should be exercised in treating HIV-positive patients with lipodystrophy with EGRIFTA  (r)  if they develop glucose intolerance or diabetes, and careful consideration should be given to discontinuing EGRIFTA  (r)  treatment in patients who do not show a clear efficacy response as judged by the degree of reduction in visceral adipose tissue by waist circumference or CT scan measurements.\n\n\n\n Since EGRIFTA  (r)  increases IGF-1, patients with diabetes who are receiving ongoing treatment with EGRIFTA  (r)  should be monitored at regular intervals for potential development or worsening of retinopathy.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Hypersensitivity reactions may occur in patients treated with EGRIFTA  (r)  . Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 3.6% of patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy treated with EGRIFTA  (r)  in the Phase 3 clinical trials. These reactions included pruritus, erythema, flushing, urticaria, and other rash. In cases of suspected hypersensitivity reactions, patients should be advised to seek prompt medical attention and treatment with EGRIFTA  (r)  should be discontinued immediately.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Injection Site Reactions\n\n\n\n  EGRIFTA  (r)  treatment may cause injection site reactions, including injection site erythema, pruritus, pain, irritation, and bruising. The incidence of injection site reactions was 24.5% in EGRIFTA  (r)  -treated patients and 14.4% in placebo-treated patients during the first 26 weeks of treatment in the Phase 3 clinical trials. For patients who continued EGRIFTA  (r)  for an additional 26 weeks, the incidence of injection site reactions was 6.1%. In order to reduce the incidence of injection site reactions, it is recommended to rotate the site of injection to different areas of the abdomen.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Acute Critical Illness\n\n\n\n  Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of growth hormone. EGRIFTA  (r)  has not been studied in patients with acute critical illness. Since EGRIFTA  (r)  stimulates growth hormone production, careful consideration should be given to discontinuing EGRIFTA  (r)  in critically ill patients.\n",

(  5.1)   \n *  Ectopic pregnancy: Women who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain after taking ella should be evaluated for ectopic pregnancy. (  5.2  ) \n *  Effect on menstrual cycle: ella may alter the next expected menses. If menses is delayed beyond 1 week, pregnancy should be ruled out. (  5.5  ) \n *   ella does not protect against STI/HIV. (  5.6  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Existing Pregnancy\n\n\n\n   ella  is not indicated for termination of an existing pregnancy. Pregnancy should be excluded before prescribing ella.  If pregnancy cannot be excluded on the basis of history and/or physical examination, pregnancy testing should be performed. A follow-up physical or pelvic examination is recommended if there is any doubt concerning the general health or pregnancy status of any woman after taking ella  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Ectopic Pregnancy\n\n\n\n  A history of ectopic pregnancy is not a contraindication to use of this emergency contraceptive method.  Healthcare providers, however, should consider the possibility of ectopic pregnancy in women who become pregnant or complain of lower abdominal pain after taking ella  .  A follow-up physical or pelvic examination is recommended if there is any doubt concerning the general health or pregnancy status of any woman after taking ella  .\n\n\n\n    5.3 Repeated Use\n\n\n\n   ella  is for occasional use as an emergency contraceptive. It should not replace a regular method of contraception. Repeated use of ella  within the same menstrual cycle is not recommended, as safety and efficacy of repeat use within the same cycle has not been evaluated.\n\n\n\n    5.4 CYP3A4 Inducers\n\n\n\n  A CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, decreases the plasma concentration of ella significantly. Ella  should not be administered with CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug interactions (  7.1  ) and Pharmacokinetics (  12.3  )]  .\n\n\n\n    5.5 Fertility Following Use\n\n\n\n  A rapid return of fertility is likely following treatment with ella  for emergency contraception; therefore, routine contraception should be continued or initiated as soon as possible following use of ella  to ensure ongoing prevention of pregnancy. While there are no data about use of ella  with regular hormonal contraceptives, due to its high affinity binding to the progesterone receptor, use of ella  may reduce the contraceptive action of regular hormonal contraceptive methods. Therefore, after use of ella  , a reliable barrier method of contraception should be used with subsequent acts of intercourse that occur in that same menstrual cycle.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Effect on Menstrual Cycle\n\n\n\n  After ella  intake, menses sometimes occur earlier or later than expected by a few days. In clinical trials, cycle length was increased by a mean of 2.5 days but returned to normal in the subsequent cycle. Seven percent of subjects reported menses occurring more than 7 days earlier than expected, and 19% reported a delay of more than 7 days. If there is a delay in the onset of expected menses beyond 1 week, rule out pregnancy.\n\n\n\n Nine percent of women studied reported intermenstrual bleeding after use of ella.  \n\n\n\n    5.7 Sexually Transmitted Infections/HIV\n\n\n\n   ella  does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n  EXCERPT:   Adverse reactions, sometimes severe and life-threatening or fatal, have been seen in clinical trials with ZALTRAP, including:\n\n\n\n *  Fistula Formation: Discontinue ZALTRAP if fistula occurs. (  2.2  ,  5.4  ) \n *  Hypertension: Monitor blood pressure and treat hypertension. Temporarily suspend ZALTRAP if hypertension is not controlled. Discontinue ZALTRAP if hypertensive crisis develops. (  2.2  ,  5.5  ) \n *  Arterial Thromboembolic Events (ATE) (e.g., transient ischemic attacks, cerebrovascular accident, angina pectoris): Discontinue ZALTRAP if ATE develops. (  5.6  ) \n *  Proteinuria: Monitor urine protein. Suspend ZALTRAP when proteinuria >= 2 grams per 24 hours. Discontinue ZALTRAP if nephrotic syndrome or thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) develops. (  2.2  ,  5.7  ) \n *  Neutropenia and Neutropenic Complications: Delay administration of ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI until neutrophil count is >= 1.5 * 10  9  /L. (5.8) \n *  Diarrhea and Dehydration: Incidence of severe diarrhea and dehydration is increased. Monitor elderly patients more closely. (  5.9  ,  8.5  ) \n *  Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS): Discontinue ZALTRAP. (  5.10  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hemorrhage\n\n\n\n  Patients treated with ZALTRAP have an increased risk of hemorrhage, including severe and sometimes fatal hemorrhagic events. In patients with mCRC, bleeding/hemorrhage (all grades) were reported in 38% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3-4 hemorrhagic events, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria, and post-procedural hemorrhage, were reported in 3% of patients receiving ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared with 1% of patients receiving placebo/FOLFIRI. Severe intracranial hemorrhage and pulmonary hemorrhage/hemoptysis including fatal events have also occurred in patients receiving ZALTRAP.\n\n\n\n Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Do not initiate ZALTRAP in patients with severe hemorrhage. Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients who develop severe hemorrhage [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.2 Gastrointestinal Perforation\n\n\n\n  Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation including fatal GI perforation can occur in patients receiving ZALTRAP. Across three Phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical studies (colorectal, pancreatic, and lung cancer populations), the incidence of GI perforation (all grades) was 0.8% for patients treated with ZALTRAP and 0.3% for patients treated with placebo. Grade 3-4 GI perforation events occurred in 0.8% of patients treated with ZALTRAP and 0.2% of patients treated with placebo.\n\n\n\n Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of GI perforation. Discontinue ZALTRAP therapy in patients who experience GI perforation [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.3 Compromised Wound Healing\n\n\n\n  ZALTRAP impairs wound healing in animal models [ see  Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)    ].\n\n\n\n Grade 3 compromised wound healing was reported in 2 patients (0.3%) treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen and in none of the patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI regimen.\n\n\n\n Suspend ZALTRAP for at least 4 weeks prior to elective surgery. Do not resume ZALTRAP for at least 4 weeks following major surgery and until the surgical wound is fully healed. For minor surgery such as central venous access port placement, biopsy, and tooth extraction, ZALTRAP may be initiated/resumed once the surgical wound is fully healed. Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients with compromised wound healing [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.4 Fistula Formation\n\n\n\n  Fistula formation involving gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal sites occurs at a higher incidence in patients treated with ZALTRAP. In patients with mCRC, fistulas (anal, enterovesical, enterocutaneous, colovaginal, intestinal sites) were reported in 9 of 611 patients (1.5%) treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen and 3 of 605 patients (0.5%) treated with placebo/FOLFIRI regimen. Grade 3 GI fistula formation occurred in 2 patients treated with ZALTRAP (0.3%) and in 1 placebo-treated patient (0.2%).\n\n\n\n Discontinue ZALTRAP therapy in patients who develop fistula [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.5 Hypertension\n\n\n\n  ZALTRAP increases the risk of Grade 3-4 hypertension. There is no clinical trial experience administering ZALTRAP to patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure. In patients with mCRC, Grade 3 hypertension (defined as requiring adjustment in existing anti-hypertensive therapy or treatment with more than one drug) was reported in 1.5% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI and 19% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI. Grade 4 hypertension (hypertensive crisis) was reported in 1 patient (0.2%) treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI. Among those patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI developing Grade 3-4 hypertension, 54% had onset during the first two cycles of treatment.\n\n\n\n Monitor blood pressure every two weeks or more frequently as clinically indicated during treatment with ZALTRAP. Treat with appropriate anti-hypertensive therapy and continue monitoring blood pressure regularly. Temporarily suspend ZALTRAP in patients with uncontrolled hypertension until controlled, and permanently reduce ZALTRAP dose to 2 mg per kg for subsequent cycles. Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients with hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.6 Arterial Thromboembolic Events\n\n\n\n  Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE), including transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, and angina pectoris, occurred more frequently in patients who have received ZALTRAP. In patients with mCRC, ATE was reported in 2.6% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 1.7% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3-4 events occurred in 11 patients (1.8%) treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 4 patients (0.7%) treated with placebo/FOLFIRI.\n\n\n\n Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients who experience an ATE [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.7 Proteinuria\n\n\n\n  Severe proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) occurred more frequently in patients treated with ZALTRAP. In patients with mCRC, proteinuria was reported in 62% patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 41% patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3-4 proteinuria occurred in 8% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI to 1% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Nephrotic syndrome occurred in 2 patients (0.5%) treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to none of the patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. TMA was reported in 3 of 2258 patients with cancer enrolled across completed studies.\n\n\n\n Monitor proteinuria by urine dipstick analysis and/or urinary protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) for the development or worsening of proteinuria during ZALTRAP therapy. Patients with a dipstick of >=2+ for protein or a UPCR greater than 1 should undergo a 24-hour urine collection.\n\n\n\n Suspend ZALTRAP administration for proteinuria 2 grams per 24 hours or more, and resume when proteinuria is less than 2 grams per 24 hours. If recurrent, suspend until proteinuria is less than 2 grams per 24 hours and then permanently reduce the ZALTRAP dose to 2 mg per kg. Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome or TMA [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.8 Neutropenia and Neutropenic Complications\n\n\n\n  A higher incidence of neutropenic complications (febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection) occurred in patients receiving ZALTRAP. In patients with mCRC, Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 37% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 30% patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Grade 3-4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 4% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 2% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3-4 neutropenic infection/sepsis occurred in 1.5% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 1.2% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI.\n\n\n\n Monitor CBC with differential count at baseline and prior to initiation of each cycle of ZALTRAP. Delay ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI until neutrophil count is at or above 1.5 * 10  9  /L.\n\n\n\n    5.9 Diarrhea and Dehydration\n\n\n\n  The incidence of severe diarrhea is increased in patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI. In patients with mCRC, Grade 3-4 diarrhea was reported in 19% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 8% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3-4 dehydration was reported in 4% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 1% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI [ see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. The incidence of diarrhea is increased in patients who are age 65 years or older as compared to patients younger than 65 years of age [ see  Geriatric Use (8.5)    ]. Monitor elderly patients closely for diarrhea.\n\n\n\n    5.10 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS)\n\n\n\n  RPLS (also known as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) was reported in 0.5% of 3795 patients treated with ZALTRAP monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy.\n\n\n\n Confirm the diagnosis of RPLS with MRI and discontinue ZALTRAP in patients who develop RPLS. Symptoms usually resolve or improve within days, although some patients have experienced ongoing neurologic sequelae or death [ see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)    ].\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *     Increases in Blood Pressure: MYRBETRIQ  (r)  can increase blood pressure. Periodic blood pressure determinations are recommended, especially in hypertensive patients. MYRBETRIQ  (r)  is not recommended for use in severe uncontrolled hypertensive patients (  5.1  ). \n *     Urinary Retention in Patients With Bladder Outlet Obstruction and in Patients Taking Antimuscarinic Drugs for Overactive Bladder: Administer with caution in these patients because of risk of urinary retention (  5.2  ). \n *     Angioedema: Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with MYRBETRIQ  (r)  (  5.3  ,  6.2  ). \n *     Patients Taking Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: MYRBETRIQ  (r)  is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. Appropriate monitoring is recommended and dose adjustment may be necessary for narrow therapeutic index CYP2D6 substrates (  5.4  ,  7.1  ,  12.3  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Increases in Blood Pressure\n\n\n\n  MYRBETRIQ  (r)  can increase blood pressure. Periodic blood pressure determinations are recommended, especially in hypertensive patients. MYRBETRIQ  (r)  is not recommended for use in patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg) [see  Clinical Pharmacology  (  12.2  )].  \n\n\n\n In two, randomized, placebo-controlled, healthy volunteer studies, MYRBETRIQ  (r)  was associated with dose-related increases in supine blood pressure. In these studies, at the maximum recommended dose of 50 mg, the mean maximum increase in systolic/diastolic blood pressure was approximately 3.5/1.5 mm Hg greater than placebo.\n\n\n\n In contrast, in OAB patients in clinical trials, the mean increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the maximum recommended dose of 50 mg was approximately 0.5 - 1 mm Hg greater than placebo. Worsening of pre-existing hypertension was reported infrequently in MYRBETRIQ  (r)  patients.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Urinary Retention in Patients with Bladder Outlet Obstruction and in Patients Taking Antimuscarinic Medications for OAB\n\n\n\n  Urinary retention in patients with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and in patients taking antimuscarinic medications for the treatment of OAB has been reported in postmarketing experience in patients taking mirabegron. A controlled clinical safety study in patients with BOO did not demonstrate increased urinary retention in MYRBETRIQ  (r)  patients; however, MYRBETRIQ  (r)  should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant BOO. MYRBETRIQ  (r)  should also be administered with caution to patients taking antimuscarinic medications for the treatment of OAB [see  Clinical Pharmacology  (  12.2  )].  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Angioedema\n\n\n\n   Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with MYRBETRIQ  (r)  . In some cases angioedema occurred after the first dose. Cases of angioedema have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue MYRBETRIQ  (r)  and initiate appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway [see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.2  )].    \n\n\n\n    5.4 Patients Taking Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6\n\n\n\n  Since mirabegron is a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor, the systemic exposure to CYP2D6 substrates such as metoprolol and desipramine is increased when co-administered with mirabegron. Therefore, appropriate monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary, especially with narrow therapeutic index drugs metabolized by CYP2D6, such as thioridazine, flecainide, and propafenone [see  Drug Interactions  (  7.1  ) and  Clinical Pharmacology  (  12.3  )]  .\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Caution should be given to prescribing EDURANT with drugs that may reduce the exposure of rilpivirine. (  5.1  ) \n *  Caution should be given to prescribing EDURANT with drugs with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes. (  5.1  ) \n *  Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during postmarketing experience, including cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), with rilpivirine-containing regimens. Immediately discontinue treatment if hypersensitivity or rash with systemic symptoms or elevations in hepatic serum biochemistries develop and closely monitor clinical status, including hepatic serum biochemistries. (  5.2  ) \n *  Depressive Disorders: Severe depressive disorders have been reported. Immediate medical evaluation is recommended for severe depressive disorders. (  5.3  ) \n *  Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients with underlying liver disease, including hepatitis B or C co-infection, or in patients with elevated baseline transaminases. A few cases of hepatotoxicity have occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease. Monitor liver function tests before and during treatment with EDURANT in patients with underlying hepatic disease, such as hepatitis B or C co-infection, or marked elevations in transaminase. Also consider monitoring liver functions tests in patients without pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors. (  5.4  ) \n *  Patients may develop redistribution/accumulation of body fat (  5.5  ) or immune reconstitution syndrome. (  5.6  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Drug Interactions\n\n\n\n  Caution should be given to prescribing EDURANT with drugs that may reduce the exposure of rilpivirine [see  Contraindications (4)  ,  Drug Interactions (7)  ,  and   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n In healthy subjects, supratherapeutic doses of rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram [see  Drug Interactions (7)    and   Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)  ]  . EDURANT should be used with caution when co-administered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n   Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during the postmarketing experience, including cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), with rilpivirine-containing regimens. While some skin reactions were accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, other skin reactions were associated with organ dysfunctions, including elevations in hepatic serum biochemistries. During the Phase 3 clinical trials, treatment-related rashes with at least Grade 2 severity were reported in 3% of subjects receiving EDURANT. No grade 4 rash was reported. Overall, most rashes were Grade 1 or 2 and occurred in the first four to six weeks of therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6  and  6.2)  ]  . Discontinue EDURANT immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop, including but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, blisters, mucosal involvement, conjunctivitis, facial edema, angioedema, hepatitis or eosinophilia. Clinical status including laboratory parameters should be monitored and appropriate therapy should be initiated.  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Depressive Disorders\n\n\n\n   The adverse reaction depressive disorders (depressed mood, depression, dysphoria, major depression, mood altered, negative thoughts, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation) has been reported with EDURANT. Patients with severe depressive symptoms should seek immediate medical evaluation to assess the possibility that the symptoms are related to EDURANT, and if so, to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits.  \n\n\n\n  During the Phase 3 trials in adults (N = 1368) through 96 weeks, the incidence of depressive disorders (regardless of causality, severity) reported among EDURANT (n = 686) or efavirenz (n = 682) was 9% and 8%, respectively. Most events were mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 depressive disorders (regardless of causality) was 1% for both EDURANT and efavirenz. The incidence of discontinuation due to depressive disorders among EDURANT or efavirenz was 1% in each arm. Suicidal ideation was reported in 4 subjects in each arm while suicide attempt was reported in 2 subjects in the EDURANT arm.  \n\n\n\n  During the Phase 2 trial in pediatric subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age (N = 36) receiving EDURANT through 48 weeks, the incidence of depressive disorders (regardless of causality, severity) was 19.4% (7/36). Most events were mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 depressive disorders (regardless of causality) was 5.6% (2/36). None of the subjects discontinued due to depressive disorders. Suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were reported in 1 subject.  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Hepatotoxicity\n\n\n\n  Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving a rilpivirine containing regimen. Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C, or marked elevations in transaminases prior to treatment may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations with use of EDURANT. A few cases of hepatic toxicity have been reported in adult patients receiving a rilpivirine containing regimen who had no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors. Appropriate laboratory testing prior to initiating therapy and monitoring for hepatotoxicity during therapy with EDURANT is recommended in patients with underlying hepatic disease such as hepatitis B or C, or in patients with marked elevations in transaminases prior to treatment initiation. Liver enzyme monitoring should also be considered for patients without pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Fat Redistribution\n\n\n\n  Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including EDURANT. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium  infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.\n\n\n\n Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.\n",

Coadministration of amiodarone with HARVONI is not recommended. In patients without alternative, viable treatment options, cardiac monitoring is recommended. (  5.1  ,  6.2  ,  7.2  ) \n *  Use with other drugs containing sofosbuvir, including SOVALDI, is not recommended (  5.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone\n\n\n\n   Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, as well as fatal cardiac arrest and cases requiring pacemaker intervention, have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with HARVONI. Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.  \n\n\n\n  Coadministration of amiodarone with HARVONI is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative, viable treatment options and who will be coadministered HARVONI:  \n\n\n\n *   Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia  \n *   Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment.  \n     Patients who are taking HARVONI who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative, viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.  \n \n\n  Due to amiodarone's long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting HARVONI should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.  \n\n\n\n  Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, confusion or memory problems [See  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to P-gp Inducers\n\n\n\n  The concomitant use of HARVONI and P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) may significantly decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced therapeutic effect of HARVONI. Therefore, the use of HARVONI with P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin or St. John's wort) is not recommended [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.3 Related Products Not Recommended\n\n\n\n  The use of HARVONI with other products containing sofosbuvir (SOVALDI  (r)  ) is not recommended.\n",

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Venous Thromboembolism: Risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism (  5.1  ) \n *  Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer (  5.2  ) \n *  Severe Hepatic Impairment (  5.3  ,  8.7  ,  12.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Cardiovascular Disorders\n\n\n\n  Risk factors for cardiovascular disorders, arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus), should be managed appropriately.\n\n\n\n    Stroke  \n\n\n\n In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per ten thousand women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted.\n\n\n\n In the clinical trials for OSPHENA (duration of treatment up to 15 months), the incidence rates of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic stroke were 0.72 and 1.45 per thousand women, respectively in OSPHENA 60 mg treatment group and 1.04 and 0 per thousand women in placebo.\n\n\n\n Should thromboembolic or hemorrhagic stroke occur or be suspected, OSPHENA should be discontinued immediately.\n\n\n\n    Coronary Heart Disease  \n\n\n\n In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, or CHD death) was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo. In the OSPHENA clinical trials, a single MI occurred in a woman receiving 60 mg of ospemifene.\n\n\n\n    Venous Thromboembolism  \n\n\n\n In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and PE), was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per ten thousand women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per ten thousand women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years.\n\n\n\n In the OSPHENA clinical trials, the incidence of DVT was 1.45 per thousand women in OSPHENA 60 mg treatment group and 1.04 per thousand women in placebo. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, OSPHENA should be discontinued immediately.\n\n\n\n If feasible, OSPHENA should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Malignant Neoplasms\n\n\n\n   Endometrial Cancer  \n\n\n\n OSPHENA is an estrogen agonist/antagonist with tissue selective effects. In the endometrium, OSPHENA has agonistic effects. In the OSPHENA clinical trials (60 mg treatment group), no cases of endometrial cancer were seen with exposure up to 52 weeks. There was a single case of simple hyperplasia without atypia. Endometrial thickening equal to 5 mm or greater was seen in the OSPHENA treatment groups at a rate of 60.1 per thousand women vs. 21.2 per thousand women for placebo. The incidence of any type of proliferative (weakly plus active plus disordered) endometrium was 86.1 per thousand women in OSPHENA vs. 13.3 per thousand women for placebo. Uterine polyps occurred at an incidence of 5.9 per thousand women vs. 1.8 per thousand women for placebo.\n\n\n\n An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears to be associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Adding a progestin to postmenopausal estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. The use of progestins with OSPHENA therapy was not evaluated in the clinical trials.\n\n\n\n Clinical surveillance of all women using OSPHENA is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.\n\n\n\n    Breast Cancer  \n\n\n\n OSPHENA 60 mg has not been adequately studied in women with breast cancer; therefore, it should not be used in women with known or suspected breast cancer or with a history of breast cancer.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Severe Hepatic Impairment\n\n\n\n  OSPHENA should not be used in women with severe hepatic impairment [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.7)  , and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ].  \n",

Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes. \n *  -   Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. \n *  -   Weight Gain: Gain in body weight has been observed. Monitor weight. \n    Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain (  5.6  ). \n *   Hyperprolactinemia: Prolactin elevations may occur (  5.7  ). \n *   Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis: Perform complete blood counts (CBC) in patients with a pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) or a history of leukopenia or neutropenia. Consider discontinuing LATUDA if a clinically significant decline in WBC occurs in the absence of other causative factors (  5.8  ). \n *   Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope: Dizziness, tachycardia or bradycardia, and syncope may occur, especially early in treatment. In patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, and in antipsychotic-naive patients, consider a lower starting dose and slower titration (  5.9  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\n\n\n\n  Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6- to 1.7-times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. LATUDA is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see  Boxed Warning  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults\n\n\n\n  Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.\n\n\n\n Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.\n\n\n\n The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk of differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in  Table 2  .\n\n\n\n Table 2 \n  Age Range                                          Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated     \n                                                    Increases Compared to Placebo                        \n <18                                                14 additional cases                                  \n 18-24                                              5 additional cases                                   \n                                                    Decreases Compared to Placebo                        \n 25-64                                              1 fewer case                                         \n >=65                                               6 fewer cases                                        \n        No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\n \n\n It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.\n\n\n\n  All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.  \n\n\n\n The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.\n\n\n\n Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.\n\n\n\n  Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for LATUDA should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\n\n\n\n  In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks), including fatalities, compared to placebo-treated subjects. LATUDA is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see also Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )].  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome\n\n\n\n  A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including LATUDA.\n\n\n\n Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.\n\n\n\n The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology.\n\n\n\n The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.\n\n\n\n If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. If reintroduced, the patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Tardive Dyskinesia\n\n\n\n  Tardive dyskinesia is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements that can develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.\n\n\n\n The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.\n\n\n\n There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.\n\n\n\n Given these considerations, LATUDA should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.\n\n\n\n If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on LATUDA, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with LATUDA despite the presence of the syndrome.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Metabolic Changes\n\n\n\n  Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.\n\n\n\n    Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus  \n\n\n\n Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Because LATUDA was not marketed at the time these studies were performed, it is not known if LATUDA is associated with this increased risk.\n\n\n\n Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.\n\n\n\n  Schizophrenia  \n\n\n\n Pooled data from short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies are presented in  Table 3  .\n\n\n\n Table 3: Change in Fasting Glucose in

This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia, when associated with hypogonadism, may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male patients [see Adverse Reactions (  6  )]  .\n\n\n\n Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro  , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase in mammary gland neoplasia was observed in a LATUDA carcinogenicity study conducted in rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology (  13  )].  Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive.\n\n\n\n  Schizophrenia  \n\n\n\n In short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, the median change from baseline to endpoint in prolactin levels for LATUDA-treated patients was +0.4 ng/mL and was -1.9 ng/mL in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline to endpoint for males was +0.5 ng/mL and for females was -0.2 ng/mL. Median changes for prolactin by dose are shown in  Table 12  .\n\n\n\n Table 12: Median Change in Prolactin (ng/mL) from Baseline in Schizophrenia Studies \n                                               LATUDA                                            \n  \n                 Placebo        20 mg/day      40 mg/day          80 mg/day       120 mg/day     160 mg/day     \n All Patients   -1.9(n=672)    -1.1(n=70)     -1.4(n=476)        -0.2(n=495)     +3.3(n=284)    +3.3(n=115)     \n Females        -5.1(n=200)    -0.7(n=19)     -4.0(n=149)        -0.2(n=150)     +6.7(n=70)     +7.1(n=36)      \n Males          -1.3(n=472)    -1.2(n=51)     -0.7(n=327)        -0.2(n=345)     +3.1(n=214)    +2.4(n=79)      \n             The proportion of patients with prolactin elevations >= 5* upper limit of normal (ULN) was 2.8% for LATUDA-treated patients versus 1.0% for placebo-treated patients. The proportion of female patients with prolactin elevations >= 5x ULN was 5.7% for LATUDA-treated patients versus 2.0% for placebo-treated female patients. The proportion of male patients with prolactin elevations >= 5x ULN was 1.6% versus 0.6% for placebo-treated male patients.\n \n\n In the uncontrolled longer-term schizophrenia studies (primarily open-label extension studies), LATUDA was associated with a median change in prolactin of -0.9 ng/mL at week 24 (n=357), -5.3ng/mL at week 36 (n=190) and -2.2 ng/mL at week 52 (n=307).\n\n\n\n    Bipolar Depression  \n\n\n\n    Monotherapy  \n\n\n\n The median change from baseline to endpoint in prolactin levels, in the short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, was +1.7 ng/mL and +3.5 ng/mL with LATUDA 20 to 60 mg/day and 80 to 120 mg/day, respectively compared to +0.3 ng/mL with placebo-treated patients.

The median change from baseline to endpoint for males was +2.4 ng/mL and for females was +3.2 ng/mL.

The proportion of male patients with prolactin elevations >= 5x ULN was 0% versus 0% for placebo-treated male patients.\n \n\n In the uncontrolled, open-label, longer-term bipolar depression study, patients who were treated with LATUDA, as adjunctive therapy with either lithium or valproate, in the short-term and continued in the longer-term study, had a median change in prolactin of -2.9 ng/mL at week 24 (n=88).\n\n\n\n    5.8 Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis\n\n\n\n  Leukopenia/neutropenia has been reported during treatment with antipsychotic agents. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in the class.\n\n\n\n Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and LATUDA should be discontinued at the first sign of decline in WBC, in the absence of other causative factors.\n\n\n\n Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm  3  ) should discontinue LATUDA and have their WBC followed until recovery.\n\n\n\n    5.9 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope\n\n\n\n  LATUDA may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, perhaps due to its alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. Associated adverse reactions can include dizziness, lightheadedness, tachycardia, and bradycardia. Generally, these risks are greatest at the beginning of treatment and during dose escalation. Patients at increased risk of these adverse reactions or at increased risk of developing complications from hypotension include those with dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with antihypertensive medication, history of cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemia, or conduction abnormalities), history of cerebrovascular disease, as well as patients who are antipsychotic-naive. In such patients, consider using a lower starting dose and slower titration, and monitor orthostatic vital signs.\n\n\n\n Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital sign measurement, was defined by the following vital sign changes: >= 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure and >= 10 bpm increase in pulse from sitting to standing or supine to standing position.\n\n\n\n    Schizophrenia  \n\n\n\n The incidence of orthostatic hypotension and syncope reported as adverse events from short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies was (LATUDA incidence, placebo incidence): orthostatic hypotension [0.3% (5/1508), 0.1% (1/708)] and syncope [0.1% (2/1508), 0% (0/708)].\n\n\n\n In short-term schizophrenia clinical studies, orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 0.8% with LATUDA 40 mg, 2.1% with LATUDA 80 mg, 1.7% with LATUDA 120 mg and 0.8% with LATUDA 160 mg compared to 0.7% with placebo.\n\n\n\n    Bipolar Depression  \n\n\n\n    Monotherapy  \n\n\n\n In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, there were no reported adverse events of orthostatic hypotension and syncope.\n\n\n\n Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 0.6% with LATUDA 20 to 60 mg and 0.6% with LATUDA 80 to 120 mg compared to 0% with placebo.\n\n\n\n  Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate  \n\n\n\n In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression therapy studies, there were no reported adverse events of orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 1.1% with LATUDA 20 to 120 mg compared to 0.9% with placebo.\n\n\n\n    5.10 Seizures\n\n\n\n  As with other antipsychotic drugs, LATUDA should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimer's dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in patients 65 years or older.\n\n\n\n  Schizophrenia  \n\n\n\n In short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, seizures/convulsions occurred in 0.1% (2/1508) of patients treated with LATUDA compared to 0.1% (1/708) placebo-treated patients.\n\n\n\n    Bipolar Depression  \n\n\n\n    Monotherapy  \n\n\n\n In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, no patient experienced seizures/convulsions.\n\n\n\n    Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate  \n\n\n\n In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, no patient experienced seizures/convulsions.\n\n\n\n    5.11 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment\n\n\n\n  LATUDA, like other antipsychotics, has the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with LATUDA does not affect them adversely.\n\n\n\n In clinical studies with LATUDA, somnolence included: hypersomnia, hypersomnolence, sedation and somnolence.\n\n\n\n    Schizophrenia  \n\n\n\n In short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, somnolence was reported by 17.0% (256/1508) of patients treated with LATUDA (15.5% LATUDA 20 mg, 15.6% LATUDA 40 mg, 15.2% LATUDA 80 mg, 26.5% LATUDA 120 mg and 8.3% LATUDA 160 mg/day) compared to 7.1% (50/708) of placebo patients.\n\n\n\n    Bipolar Depression  \n\n\n\n    Monotherapy  \n\n\n\n In the short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, somnolence was reported by 7.3% (12/164) and 13.8% (23/167) with LATUDA 20 to 60 mg and 80 to120 mg, respectively compared to 6.5% (11/168) of placebo patients.\n\n\n\n    Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate  \n\n\n\n In the short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, somnolence was reported by 11.4% (41/360) of patients treated with LATUDA 20-120 mg compared to 5.1% (17/334) of placebo patients.\n\n\n\n    5.12 Body Temperature Dysregulation\n\n\n\n  Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing LATUDA for patients who will be experiencing conditions that may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration [see Patient Counseling Information (  17.9  )].  \n\n\n\n    5.13 Suicide\n\n\n\n  The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illness and close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for LATUDA should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose.\n\n\n\n    Schizophrenia  \n\n\n\n In short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, the incidence of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was 0.4% (6/1508) for LATUDA-treated patients compared to 0.8% (6/708) on placebo. No suicide attempts or completed suicides were reported in these studies.\n\n\n\n    Bipolar Depression  \n\n\n\n    Monotherapy  \n\n\n\n In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, the incidence of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was 0.0% (0/331) with LATUDA-treated patients compared to 0.0% (0/168) with placebo-treated patients. No suicide attempts or completed suicides were reported in this study.\n\n\n\n    Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate  \n\n\n\n In the short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, the incidence of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was 1.1% (4/360) for LATUDA-treated patients compared to 0.3% (1/334) on placebo. No suicide attempts or completed suicides were reported in these studies.\n\n\n\n    5.14 Activation of Mania/Hypomania\n\n\n\n  Antidepressant treatment can increase the risk of developing a manic or hypomanic episode, particularly in patients with bipolar disorder. Monitor patients for the emergence of such episodes.\n\n\n\n In the bipolar depression monotherapy and adjunctive therapy (with lithium or valproate) studies, less than 1% of subjects in the LATUDA and placebo groups developed manic or hypomanic episodes.\n\n\n\n    5.15 Dysphagia\n\n\n\n  Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. LATUDA and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.\n\n\n\n    5.16 Neurological Adverse Reactions in Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies\n\n\n\n  Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies are reported to have an increased sensitivity to antipsychotic medication. Manifestations of this increased sensitivity include confusion, obtundation, postural instability with frequent falls, extrapyramidal symptoms, and clinical features consistent with the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Myocardial Ischemia. Fatal cardiac events have occurred. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia, for example unstable angina or cardiovascular instability, who may be at greater risk. Cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff should be available before administration (  5.1  ) \n *    Sinoatrial (SA) and Atrioventricular (AV) Nodal Block. Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, can depress the SA and AV nodes and may cause first-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia (  5.2  ) \n *    Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter. New-onset or recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atrial flutter have been reported (  5.3  ) \n *    Hypersensitivity, including Anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis, angioedema, cardiac or respiratory arrest, respiratory distress, decreased oxygen saturation, hypotension, throat tightness, urticaria, and rashes have occurred. Have personnel and resuscitative equipment immediately available (  5.4  ) \n *    Hypotension. Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, induce vasodilation and hypotension. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency, or hypovolemia (  5.5  ) \n *    Hypertension. Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, may induce clinically significant increases in blood pressure particularly in patients with a history of hypertension and when the MPI includes low level exercise (  5.6  ) \n *    Bronchoconstriction. Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, may induce dyspnea, bronchoconstriction and respiratory compromise in patients with COPD or asthma. Resuscitative measures should be available (  5.7  ) \n *    Seizure. Lexiscan may lower the seizure threshold. New onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures has occurred. Some seizures are prolonged and require urgent anticonvulsive management. Methylxanthine use is not recommended in patients who experience a seizure in association with Lexiscan (  5.8  ) \n *    Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke). Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred (  5.9  ) \n    \n \n\n    5.1 Myocardial Ischemia  \n\n\n\n   Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest have occurred following Lexiscan injection. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia, for example unstable angina or cardiovascular instability; these patients may be at greater risk of serious cardiovascular reactions to Lexiscan. Cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff should be available before administering Lexiscan. If serious reactions to Lexiscan occur, consider the use of aminophylline, an adenosine antagonist, to shorten the duration of increased coronary blood flow induced by Lexiscan [ see  Overdosage  (  10  )  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Sinoatrial and Atrioventricular Nodal Block\n\n\n\n  Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, can depress the SA and AV nodes and may cause first-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia requiring intervention. In clinical trials first-degree AV block (PR prolongation > 220 msec) developed in 3% of patients within 2 hours of Lexiscan administration; transient second-degree AV block with one dropped beat was observed in one patient receiving Lexiscan. In post-marketing experience, third-degree heart block and asystole within minutes of Lexiscan administration have occurred [ see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.2  )  ].\n\n\n\n     5.3 Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter  \n\n\n\n   New-onset or recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atrial flutter have been reported following Lexiscan injection [ see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.2  )  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Hypersensitivity, Including Anaphylaxis\n\n\n\n  Anaphylaxis, angioedema, cardiac or respiratory arrest, respiratory distress, decreased oxygen saturation, hypotension, throat tightness, urticaria and rashes have occurred. In clinical trials, hypersensitivity reactions were reported in fewer than 1 percent of patients [ see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.1  )  ]. Have personnel and resuscitative equipment immediately available.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Hypotension\n\n\n\n  Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, induce arterial vasodilation and hypotension. In clinical trials, decreased systolic blood pressure (> 35 mm Hg) was observed in 7% of patients and decreased diastolic blood pressure (> 25 mm Hg) was observed in 4% of patients within 45 min of Lexiscan administration. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, hypovolemia, left main coronary artery stenosis, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, or stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency. In post-marketing experience, syncope, transient ischemic attacks and seizures have been observed [ see  Adverse Reactions   (  6.2  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.6 Hypertension\n\n\n\n  Administration of adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, may result in clinically significant increases in blood pressure in some patients. Among patients who experienced an increase in blood pressure in clinical trials, the increase was observed within minutes of Lexiscan administration. Most increases resolved within 10 to 15 minutes, but in some cases, increases were observed at 45 minutes following administration [ see  Clinical Pharmacology  (  12.2  )  ]. In post-marketing experience, cases of potentially clinically significant hypertension have been reported, particularly with underlying hypertension and when low-level exercise was included in the MPI [ see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.2  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.7 Bronchoconstriction\n\n\n\n  Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, may cause dyspnea, bronchoconstriction, and respiratory compromise. Appropriate bronchodilator therapy and resuscitative measures should be available prior to Lexiscan administration [ see  Adverse Reactions  (  6.1  ),  Clinical Pharmacology  (  12.2  ),  Overdosage  (  10  ) and  Patient Counseling Information  (  17  )  ].\n\n\n\n     5.8 Seizure  \n\n\n\n   Lexiscan may lower the seizure threshold. New-onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures has occurred following Lexiscan injection. Some seizures are prolonged and require emergent anticonvulsive management. Aminophylline may increase the risk of seizures associated with Lexiscan injection. Methylxanthine use is not recommended in patients who experience a seizure in association with Lexiscan administration.  \n\n\n\n     5.9 Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke)  \n\n\n\n   Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred. Hemodynamic effects of Lexiscan including hypotension or hypertension may be associated with these adverse reactions [ see  Warnings and Precautions  (  5.5  ) and (  5.6  )  ].  \n",

Dyspnea resulting from BRILINTA is self-limiting.  (5.3)   \n *    Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor.  (5.5)   \n    \n \n\n    5.1 General Risk of Bleeding  \n\n\n\n   Drugs that inhibit platelet function including BRILINTA increase the risk of bleeding [see   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].  \n\n\n\n  If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing BRILINTA. Stopping BRILINTA increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events [ see        Warnings and Precautions (5.4)        and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ].  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Concomitant Aspirin Maintenance Dose\n\n\n\n  In PLATO the use of BRILINTA with maintenance doses of aspirin above 100 mg decreased the effectiveness of BRILINTA. Therefore, after the initial loading dose of aspirin, use BRILINTA with a maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg [ see     Dosage and Administration (2.1)     and     Clinical Studies (14.1)    ] .  \n\n\n\n     5.3 Dyspnea  \n\n\n\n   In clinical trials, about 14% of patients treated with BRILINTA developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment, but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% of BRILINTA and 0.1% of clopidogrel patients in PLATO and 4.3% of BRILINTA 60 mg and 0.7% on aspirin alone patients in PEGASUS.  \n\n\n\n  In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment.  \n\n\n\n  If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to BRILINTA, no specific treatment is required; continue BRILINTA without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of BRILINTA, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent.  \n\n\n\n     5.4 Discontinuation of BRILINTA  \n\n\n\n   Discontinuation of BRILINTA will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. If BRILINTA must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with BRILINTA for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume BRILINTA as soon as hemostasis is achieved.  \n\n\n\n     5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment  \n\n\n\n   Avoid use of BRILINTA in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of BRILINTA patients with severe hepatic impairment [see   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)    ].  \n",

Manage with excision and continue treatment without dose adjustment. (  5.1  ) \n *  New Non-Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Evaluate for symptoms or clinical signs of new non-cutaneous SCC before initiation of treatment and periodically during treatment. (  5.1  ) \n *  Other Malignancies: Monitor patients receiving ZELBORAF closely for signs or symptoms of other malignancies (  5.1  ). \n *  Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Melanoma: Increased cell proliferation can occur with BRAF inhibitors (  5.2  ). \n *  Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions including anaphylaxis and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS Syndrome): Discontinue ZELBORAF for severe hypersensitivity reactions. (  5.3  ) \n *  Severe Dermatologic Reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis: Discontinue ZELBORAF for severe dermatologic reactions. (  5.4  ) \n *  QT Prolongation: Monitor ECG and electrolytes before and during treatment. Withhold ZELBORAF for QTc of 500 ms or greater. Correct electrolyte abnormalities and control for cardiac risk factors for QT prolongation. (  5.5  ) \n *  Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin before initiating ZELBORAF and monthly during treatment. (  5.6  ) \n *  Photosensitivity: Advise patients to avoid sun exposure. (  5.7  ) \n *  Serious Ophthalmologic Reactions: Monitor for signs and symptoms of uveitis. (  5.8  ) \n *  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: May cause fetal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. (  5.9  ,  8.1  ) \n *  Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall: Severe cases have been reported. (  5.10  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 New Primary Malignancies\n\n\n\n   Cutaneous Malignancies  \n\n\n\n Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, keratoacanthoma, and melanoma occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving ZELBORAF compared to those in the control arm in Trial 1. The incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cuSCC) and keratoacanthomas in the ZELBORAF arm was 24% compared to < 1% in the dacarbazine arm [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . The median time to the first appearance of cuSCC was 7 to 8 weeks; approximately 33% of patients who developed a cuSCC while receiving ZELBORAF experienced at least one additional occurrence with median time between occurrences of 6 weeks. Potential risk factors associated with cuSCC observed in clinical studies using ZELBORAF included age (>= 65 years), prior skin cancer, and chronic sun exposure.\n\n\n\n In Trial 1, new primary malignant melanoma occurred in 2.1% (7/336) of patients receiving ZELBORAF compared to none of the patients receiving dacarbazine.\n\n\n\n Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiation of therapy and every 2 months while on therapy. Manage suspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Consider dermatologic monitoring for 6 months following discontinuation of ZELBORAF.\n\n\n\n    Non-Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma  \n\n\n\n Non-cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the head and neck can occur in patients receiving ZELBORAF [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor patients receiving ZELBORAF closely for signs or symptoms of new non-cutaneous SCC.\n\n\n\n    Other Malignancies  \n\n\n\n Based on mechanism of action, ZELBORAF may promote malignancies associated with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2)  ]  . Monitor patients receiving ZELBORAF closely for signs or symptoms of other malignancies.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Melanoma\n\n\n\n  In vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells that are exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of BRAF V600E mutation in tumor specimens prior to initiation of ZELBORAF [see  Indications and Usage (1)  and  Dosage and Administration (2.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Anaphylaxis and other serious hypersensitivity reactions can occur during treatment and upon re-initiation of treatment with ZELBORAF. Severe hypersensitivity reactions included generalized rash and erythema, hypotension, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome). Permanently discontinue ZELBORAF in patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.4 Dermatologic Reactions\n\n\n\n  Severe dermatologic reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, can occur in patients receiving ZELBORAF. Permanently discontinue ZELBORAF in patients who experience a severe dermatologic reaction [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.5 QT Prolongation\n\n\n\n  Concentration-dependent QT prolongation occurred in an uncontrolled, open-label QT sub-study in previously treated patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic melanoma [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)]  . QT prolongation may lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, including Torsade de Pointes.\n\n\n\n Do not start treatment in patients with uncorrectable electrolyte abnormalities, QTc > 500 ms, or long QT syndrome, or in patients who are taking medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval. Prior to and following treatment initiation or after dose modification of ZELBORAF for QTc prolongation, evaluate ECG and electrolytes (including potassium, magnesium, and calcium) after 15 days, monthly during the first 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter or more often as clinically indicated.\n\n\n\n Withhold ZELBORAF in patients who develop QTc > 500 ms (Grade 3). Upon recovery to QTc <= 500 ms (Grade <= 2), restart at a reduced dose. Permanently discontinue ZELBORAF treatment if the QTc interval remains > 500 ms and increased > 60 ms from pre-treatment values after controlling cardiac risk factors for QT prolongation (e.g., electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart failure, and bradyarrhythmias) [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.6 Hepatotoxicity\n\n\n\n   Liver injury leading to functional hepatic impairment, including coagulopathy or other organ dysfunction, can occur with ZELBORAF [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Monitor transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin before initiation of treatment and monthly during treatment, or as clinically indicated. Manage laboratory abnormalities with dose reduction, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation [see  Dosage and Administration (2.3)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    Concurrent Administration with Ipilimumab  \n\n\n\n The safety and effectiveness of ZELBORAF in combination with ipilimumab have not been established [see  Indications and Usage (1)  ]  . In a dose-finding trial, Grade 3 increases in transaminases and bilirubin occurred in a majority of patients who received concurrent ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) and vemurafenib (960 mg BID or 720 mg BID) [see  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.7 Photosensitivity\n\n\n\n  Mild to severe photosensitivity can occur in patients treated with ZELBORAF [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Advise patients to avoid sun exposure, wear protective clothing and use a broad spectrum UVA/UVB sunscreen and lip balm (SPF >= 30) when outdoors.\n\n\n\n Institute dose modifications for intolerable Grade 2 or greater photosensitivity [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.8 Ophthalmologic Reactions\n\n\n\n  Uveitis, blurry vision, and photophobia can occur in patients treated with ZELBORAF. In Trial 1, uveitis, including iritis, occurred in 2.1% (7/336) of patients receiving ZELBORAF compared to no patients in the dacarbazine arm. Treatment with steroid and mydriatic ophthalmic drops may be required to manage uveitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of uveitis.\n\n\n\n    5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  ZELBORAF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.10 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall\n\n\n\n   Radiation sensitization and recall, in some cases severe, involving cutaneous and visceral organs have been reported in patients treated with radiation prior to, during, or subsequent to vemurafenib treatment [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ].    \n\n\n\n  Monitor patients closely when vemurafenib is administered concomitantly or sequentially with radiation treatment.  \n",

        "section_text": "     5       WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor for suicidal thoughts or behavior (  5.2  ) \n *  Neurologic Effects: Monitor for dizziness, gait disturbance, somnolence, and fatigue (  5.3  )Patients should use caution when driving or operating machinery (  5.3  ) \n *  Falls: Monitor for falls and injuries (  5.4  ) \n *  Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: In patients with epilepsy, there may be an increase in seizure frequency (  5.5  ) \n    \n \n\n    5.1 Serious   P   sychiatric   and Behavioral   Reactions  \n\n\n\n  In the controlled partial-onset seizure clinical trials, hostility- and aggression-related adverse reactions occurred in 12% and 20% of patients randomized to receive FYCOMPA at doses of 8 mg and 12 mg per day, respectively, compared to 6% of patients in the placebo group. These effects were dose-related and generally appeared within the first 6 weeks of treatment, although new events continued to be observed through more than 37 weeks. FYCOMPA-treated patients experienced more hostility- and aggression-related adverse reactions that were serious, severe, and led to dose reduction, interruption, and discontinuation more frequently than placebo-treated patients. \n\n\n\n In general, in placebo-controlled partial-onset seizure clinical trials, neuropsychiatric events were reported more frequently in patients being treated with FYCOMPA than in patients taking placebo. These events included irritability, aggression, anger, and anxiety, which occurred in 2% or greater of FYCOMPA-treated patients and twice as frequently as in placebo-treated patients. Other symptoms that occurred with FYCOMPA and were more common than with placebo included belligerence, affect lability, agitation, and physical assault. Some of these events were reported as serious and life-threatening. Homicidal ideation and/or threat were exhibited in 0.1% of 4,368 FYCOMPA-treated patients in controlled and open label trials, including non-epilepsy trials .    Homicidal ideation and/or threat have also been reported postmarketing in patients treated with FYCOMPA.\n\n\n\n In the partial-onset seizure clinical trials, these events occurred in patients with and without prior psychiatric history, prior aggressive behavior, or concomitant use of medications associated with hostility and aggression. Some patients experienced worsening of their pre-existing psychiatric conditions. Patients with active psychotic disorders and unstable recurrent affective disorders were excluded from the clinical trials. The combination of alcohol and FYCOMPA significantly worsened mood and increased anger. Patients taking FYCOMPA should avoid the use of alcohol [ see   Drug Interactions (     7.3     )  ]. \n\n\n\n Similar serious psychiatric and behavioral events were observed in the primary generalized tonic-clonic seizure clinical trial.\n\n\n\n In healthy volunteers taking FYCOMPA, observed psychiatric events included paranoia, euphoric mood, agitation, anger, mental status changes, and disorientation/confusional state. \n\n\n\n In the non-epilepsy trials, psychiatric events that occurred in perampanel-treated patients more often than placebo-treated patients included disorientation, delusion, and paranoia. \n\n\n\n Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that FYCOMPA may increase the risk of psychiatric events. Patients should be monitored during treatment and for at least 1 month after the last dose of FYCOMPA, and especially when taking higher doses and during the initial few weeks of drug therapy (titration period) or at other times of dose increases. Dose of FYCOMPA should be reduced if these symptoms occur. Permanently discontinue FYCOMPA for persistent severe or worsening psychiatric symptoms or behaviors and refer for psychiatric evaluation. \n\n\n\n     5.   2   Suicidal Behavior and Ideation  \n\n\n\n  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including FYCOMPA, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.\n\n\n\n Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\n\n\n\n The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.\n\n\n\n The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.\n\n\n\n Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.\n\n\n\n Table 1. Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis \n Indication       Placebo Patients with Events per 1000 Patients  Drug Patients with Events per 1000 patients  Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo Patients  Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events per 1000 Patients   \n Epilepsy         1.0              3.4              3.5              2.4               \n Psychiatric      5.7              8.5              1.5              2.9               \n Other            1.0              1.8              1.9              0.9               \n Total            2.4              4.3              1.8              1.9               \n           The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.\n \n\n Anyone considering prescribing FYCOMPA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.\n\n\n\n Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.\n\n\n\n     5.   3       Neurologic Effects  \n\n\n\n   Dizziness and   Gait Disturbance      FYCOMPA caused dose-related increases in events related to dizziness and disturbance in gait or coordination [ see Adverse Reactions (     6.1     )]  . In the controlled partial-onset seizure clinical trials, dizziness and vertigo were reported in 35% and 47% of patients randomized to receive FYCOMPA at doses of 8 mg and 12 mg per day, respectively, compared to 10% of placebo-treated patients. The gait disturbance related events (including ataxia, gait disturbance, balance disorder, and abnormal coordination) were reported in 12% and 16% of patients randomized to receive FYCOMPA at doses of 8 mg and 12 mg per day, respectively, compared to 2% of placebo-treated patients. Elderly patients had an increased risk of these adverse reactions compared to younger adults and pediatric patients.\n\n\n\n These adverse reactions occurred mostly during the titration phase and led to discontinuation in 3% of FYCOMPA-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients. \n\n\n\n These adverse reactions were also observed in the primary generalized tonic-clonic seizure clinical trial.\n\n\n\n  Somnolence and Fatigue  FYCOMPA caused dose-dependent increases in somnolence and fatigue-related events (including fatigue, asthenia, and lethargy).\n\n\n\n In the controlled partial-onset seizure clinical trials, 16% and 18% of patients randomized to receive FYCOMPA at doses of 8 mg and 12 mg per day, respectively, reported somnolence compared to 7% of placebo patients. In the controlled partial-onset seizure clinical trials, 12% and 15% of patients randomized to receive FYCOMPA at doses of 8 mg and 12 mg per day, respectively, reported fatigue-related events compared to 5% of placebo patients. Somnolence or fatigue-related events led to discontinuation in 2% of FYCOMPA-treated patients and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Elderly patients had an increased risk of these adverse reactions compared to younger adults and pediatric patients.\n\n\n\n In the controlled partial-onset seizure clinical trials, these adverse reactions occurred mostly during the titration phase. \n\n\n\n These adverse reactions were also observed in the primary generalized tonic-clonic seizure clinical trial.\n\n\n\n  Risk Amelioration  Prescribers should advise patients against engaging in hazardous activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating motor vehicles or dangerous machinery, until the effect of FYCOMPA is known.\n\n\n\n     5.   4   Falls  \n\n\n\n  An increased risk of falls, in some cases leading to serious injuries including head injuries and bone fracture, occurred in patients being treated with FYCOMPA (with and without concurrent seizures). In the controlled partial-onset seizure clinical trials, falls were reported in 5% and 10% of patients randomized to receive FYCOMPA at doses of 8 mg and 12 mg per day, respectively, compared to 3% of placebo-treated patients. Falls were reported as serious and led to discontinuation more frequently in FYCOMPA-treated patients than placebo-treated patients. Elderly patients had an increased risk of falls compared to younger adults and pediatric patients.\n\n\n\n     5.   5   Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs  \n\n\n\n  There is the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders when antiepileptic drugs are withdrawn abruptly. FYCOMPA has a half-life of approximately 105 hours so that even after abrupt cessation, blood levels fall gradually. In epilepsy clinical trials FYCOMPA was withdrawn without down-titration. Although a small number of patients exhibited seizures following discontinuation, the data were not sufficient to allow any recommendations regarding appropriate withdrawal regimens. A gradual withdrawal is generally recommended with antiepileptic drugs, but if withdrawal is a response to adverse events, prompt withdrawal can be considered.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Myelosuppression: ISTODAX can cause thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (neutropenia and lymphopenia), and anemia; monitor blood counts during treatment with ISTODAX; interrupt and/or modify the dose as necessary (  2.2  ). \n *  Infections: Fatal and serious infections. Reactivation of DNA viruses (Epstein Barr and hepatitis B). Consider monitoring and prophylaxis in patients with evidence of prior hepatitis B (  5.2  ). \n *  Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes: Consider cardiovascular monitoring in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, a history of significant cardiovascular disease, and patients taking medicinal products that lead to significant QT prolongation. Ensure that potassium and magnesium are within the normal range before administration of ISTODAX (  5.3  ). \n *  Tumor lysis syndrome: Patients with advanced stage disease and/or high tumor burden are at greater risk and should be closely monitored and appropriate precautions taken (  5.4  ). \n *  Embryo-fetal toxicity: ISTODAX may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid pregnancy while receiving ISTODAX (  5.5  ,  8.1  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Myelosuppression\n\n\n\n  Treatment with ISTODAX can cause thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (neutropenia and lymphopenia), and anemia. Monitor blood counts regularly during treatment with ISTODAX, and modify the dose as necessary [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Infections\n\n\n\n   Fatal and serious infections, including pneumonia, sepsis, and viral reactivation, including Epstein Barr and hepatitis B viruses, have been reported in clinical trials with ISTODAX. These can occur during treatment and within 30 days after treatment. The risk of life threatening infections may be greater in patients with a history of prior treatment with monoclonal antibodies directed against lymphocyte antigens and in patients with disease involvement of the bone marrow [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].    \n\n\n\n  Reactivation of hepatitis B virus infection has occurred in 1% of PTCL patients in clinical trials in Western populations [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ]  . In patients with evidence of prior hepatitis B infection, consider monitoring for reactivation, and consider antiviral prophylaxis.  \n\n\n\n  Reactivation of Epstein Barr viral infection leading to liver failure has occurred in a trial of patients with relapsed or refractory extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. In one case, ganciclovir prophylaxis failed to prevent Epstein Barr viral reactivation.  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Electrocardiographic Changes\n\n\n\n  Several treatment-emergent morphological changes in ECGs (including T-wave and ST-segment changes) have been reported in clinical studies. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  \n\n\n\n In patients with congenital long QT syndrome, patients with a history of significant cardiovascular disease, and patients taking anti-arrhythmic medicines or medicinal products that lead to significant QT prolongation, consider cardiovascular monitoring of ECGs at baseline and periodically during treatment.\n\n\n\n Confirm that potassium and magnesium levels are within normal range before administration of ISTODAX [see  Adverse Reactions (6)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported to occur in 1% of patients with tumor stage CTCL and 2% of patients with Stage III/IV PTCL. Patients with advanced stage disease and/or high tumor burden may be at greater risk, should be closely monitored, and managed as appropriate.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Use in Pregnancy\n\n\n\n  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ISTODAX in pregnant women. However, based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, ISTODAX may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In an animal reproductive study, romidepsin was embryocidal and resulted in adverse effects on the developing fetus at exposures below those in patients at the recommended dose of 14 mg/m  2  /week. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking ISTODAX, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .\n",

Iris pigmentation is likely to be permanent. (  5.1  )\n \n\n *  Eyelash Changes \n    Gradual changes to eyelashes including increased length, thickness and number of lashes. Usually reversible. (  5.2  )\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   5.1 Pigmentation\n\n\n\n  Tafluprost ophthalmic solution has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues. The most frequently reported changes have been increased pigmentation of the iris, periorbital tissue (eyelid) and eyelashes. Pigmentation is expected to increase as long as tafluprost is administered. The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. After discontinuation of tafluprost, pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent, while pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash changes have been reported to be reversible in some patients. Patients who receive treatment should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation. The long term effects of increased pigmentation are not known.\n\n\n\n Iris color change may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts of the iris become more brownish. Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by treatment. While treatment with ZIOPTAN  (r)  can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly. [See Patient Counseling Information (  17.3  )].  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Eyelash Changes\n\n\n\n  ZIOPTAN  (r)  may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye. These changes include increased length, color, thickness, shape and number of lashes. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Intraocular Inflammation\n\n\n\n  ZIOPTAN  (r)  should be used with caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation (e.g., iritis/uveitis) because the inflammation may be exacerbated.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Macular Edema\n\n\n\n  Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with prostaglandin F2alpha analogs. ZIOPTAN  (r)  should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema.\n",

        "section_text": "     5        WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *   Hypocortisolism:  Decreases in circulating levels of cortisol may occur resulting in biochemical and/or clinical hypocortisolism. SIGNIFOR dose reduction or interruption and/or adding a low-dose short-term glucocorticoid may be necessary (  5.1  ) \n *   Hyperglycemia and Diabetes  (occurs with initiation): Intensive glucose monitoring is recommended and may require initiation or adjustment of anti-diabetic treatment per standard of care (  5.2  ) \n *   Bradycardia and QT Prolongation:  Use with caution in at-risk patients; ECG testing prior to dosing and on treatment (  5.3  ,  7.1  ) \n *   Liver Test Elevations:  Evaluate liver tests prior to and during treatment (  5.4  ) \n *   Cholelithiasis:  Perform gallbladder ultrasounds before starting treatment and at 6-month intervals (  5.5  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1       Hypocortisolism\n\n\n\n  Treatment with SIGNIFOR leads to suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion in Cushing's disease. Suppression of ACTH may lead to a decrease in circulating levels of cortisol and potentially hypocortisolism.\n\n\n\n Monitor and instruct patients on the signs and symptoms associated with hypocortisolism (e.g., weakness, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hyponatremia or hypoglycemia). If hypocortisolism occurs, consider temporary dose reduction or interruption of treatment with SIGNIFOR, as well as temporary, exogenous glucocorticoid replacement therapy.\n\n\n\n    5.2       Hyperglycemia and Diabetes \n\n\n\n  Elevations in blood glucose levels have been seen in healthy volunteers and patients treated with SIGNIFOR. In the Phase III trial, the development of pre-diabetes and diabetes was observed  [see Clinical Studies (14)]  . In this trial, nearly all patients-including those with normal glucose status at baseline, pre-diabetes, and diabetes-developed worsening glycemia in the first two weeks of treatment. Cushing's disease patients with poor glycemic control (as defined by HbA1c values >8% while receiving anti-diabetic therapy) may be at a higher risk of developing severe hyperglycemia and associated complications, e.g., ketoacidosis. \n\n\n\n Because of this predictable adverse reaction, the glycemic status [fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)] should be assessed prior to starting treatment with SIGNIFOR. In patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus intensive anti-diabetic therapy should be optimized prior to treatment with SIGNIFOR. Self-monitoring of blood glucose and/or FPG assessments should be done every week for the first two to three months and periodically thereafter, as clinically appropriate, as well as over the first two to four weeks after any dose increase. After treatment discontinuation, glycemic monitoring (e.g., FPG or HbA1c) should be done according to clinical practice. Patients who were initiated on anti-diabetic therapy as a result of SIGNIFOR may require closer monitoring after discontinuation of SIGNIFOR, especially if the anti-diabetic therapy has a risk of causing hypoglycemia.\n\n\n\n If hyperglycemia develops in a patient treated with SIGNIFOR, the initiation or adjustment of anti-diabetic treatment per standard of care is recommended. The optimal treatment for the management of SIGNIFOR-induced hyperglycemia is not known. If uncontrolled hyperglycemia persists, despite appropriate medical management, the dose of SIGNIFOR should be reduced or discontinued.\n\n\n\n    5.3       Bradycardia and QT Prolongation\n\n\n\n   Bradycardia  \n\n\n\n Bradycardia has been reported with the use of SIGNIFOR  [see Adverse Reactions (6)]  . Patients with cardiac disease and/or risk factors for bradycardia, such as history of clinically significant bradycardia, high-grade heart block, or concomitant use of drugs associated with bradycardia, should be carefully monitored. Dose adjustments of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or correction of electrolyte disturbances may be necessary.\n\n\n\n  QT Prolongation  \n\n\n\n SIGNIFOR is associated with QT prolongation. In two thorough QT studies with SIGNIFOR, QT prolongation occurred at therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses. SIGNIFOR should be used with caution in patients who are at significant risk of developing prolongation of QTc, such as those:\n\n\n\n *  with congenital long QT prolongation. \n *  with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia. \n *  on anti-arrhythmic therapy or other substances that are known to lead to QT prolongation. \n *  with hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia. \n    A baseline ECG is recommended prior to initiating therapy with SIGNIFOR and monitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is advisable. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to SIGNIFOR administration and should be monitored periodically during therapy. \n \n\n    5.4       Liver Test Elevations\n\n\n\n  In the Phase III trial, 5% of patients had an ALT or AST level greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the entire clinical development program of SIGNIFOR, there were 4 cases of concurrent elevations in ALT (alanine aminotransferase) greater than 3 x ULN and bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN: one patient with Cushing's disease and three healthy volunteers [see Adverse Reactions (6   )]  . In these cases, total bilirubin elevations were seen either concomitantly or preceding the transaminase elevation.\n\n\n\n Monitoring of liver tests should be done after 1 to 2 weeks on treatment, then monthly for 3 months, and every 6 months thereafter. If ALT is normal at baseline and elevations of ALT of 3-5 times the ULN are observed on treatment, repeat the test within a week or within 48 hours if exceeding 5 times ULN. If ALT is abnormal at baseline and elevations of ALT of 3-5 times the baseline values are observed on treatment, repeat the test within a week or sooner if exceeding 5 times ULN. Tests should be done in a laboratory that can provide same-day results. If the values are confirmed or rising, interrupt SIGNIFOR treatment and investigate for probable cause of the findings, which may or may not be SIGNIFOR-related. Serial measures of ALT, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, should be done weekly, or more frequently, if any value exceeds 5 times the baseline value in case of abnormal baselines or 5 times the ULN in case of normal baselines. If resolution of abnormalities to normal or near normal occurs, resuming treatment with SIGNIFOR may be done cautiously, with close observation, and only if some other likely cause has been found.\n\n\n\n    5.5       Cholelithiasis \n\n\n\n  Cholelithiasis has been frequently reported in clinical studies with SIGNIFOR  [see Adverse Reactions (6)]  . Ultrasonic examination of the gallbladder before, and at 6- to 12-month intervals during SIGNIFOR therapy is recommended.\n\n\n\n    5.6       Monitoring for Deficiency of Pituitary Hormones\n\n\n\n  As the pharmacological activity of SIGNIFOR mimics that of somatostatin, inhibition of pituitary hormones, other than ACTH, may occur. Monitoring of pituitary function (e.g., TSH/free T4, GH/IGF-1) should occur prior to initiation of therapy with SIGNIFOR and periodically during treatment should be considered as clinically appropriate. Patients who have undergone transsphenoidal surgery and pituitary irradiation are particularly at increased risk for deficiency of pituitary hormones. \n",

Coadministration of amiodarone with SOVALDI in combination with another DAA is not recommended. In patients without alternative, viable treatment options, cardiac monitoring is recommended. (  5.1  ,  6.2  ,  7.1  ) \n *  Use with other drugs containing sofosbuvir is not recommended (  5.4  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone and Another HCV Direct Acting Antiviral\n\n\n\n   Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with SOVALDI in combination with an investigational agent (NS5A inhibitor) or simeprevir. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient receiving a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (HARVONI (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir)). Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.  \n\n\n\n  Coadministration of amiodarone with SOVALDI in combination with another direct acting antiviral (DAA) is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative, viable treatment options and who will be coadministered SOVALDI and another DAA:  \n\n\n\n *   Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia  \n *   Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment.  \n     Patients who are taking SOVALDI in combination with another DAA who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative, viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.  \n \n\n  Due to amiodarone's long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting SOVALDI in combination with a DAA should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.  \n\n\n\n  Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pains, confusion or memory problems [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ,  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Use with P-gp Inducers\n\n\n\n   Drugs that are P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) may significantly decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced therapeutic effect of SOVALDI. The use of rifampin and St. John's wort with SOVALDI is not recommended [see  Drug Interactions (7.1)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment\n\n\n\n   Because SOVALDI is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for treatment of HCV infection, consult the prescribing information for these drugs used in combination with SOVALDI. Warnings and Precautions related to these drugs also apply to their use in SOVALDI combination treatment.  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Related Products Not Recommended\n\n\n\n   The use of SOVALDI with other products containing sofosbuvir is not recommended.  \n",

(  5.1  ,  6.2  ,  7.3  ) \n *  Hepatic Decompensation and Hepatic Failure: Hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure, including fatal cases have been reported in patients with advanced and/or decompensated cirrhosis. Monitor liver chemistry tests before and during OLYSIO combination therapy. (  5.2  ) \n *  Photosensitivity: Serious photosensitivity reactions have been observed during OLYSIO combination therapy. Use sun protection measures and limit sun exposure during OLYSIO combination therapy. Consider discontinuation if a photosensitivity reaction occurs. (  5.4  ) \n *  Rash: Rash has been observed during OLYSIO combination therapy. Discontinue OLYSIO if severe rash occurs. (  5.5  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Co-administered with Sofosbuvir and Amiodarone\n\n\n\n  Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is co-administered with sofosbuvir in combination with another HCV direct acting antiviral, including OLYSIO. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient receiving a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir). Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with co-administration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment.

For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative treatment options, and who will be co-administered OLYSIO and sofosbuvir:\n\n\n\n *   Counsel patients about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia  \n *   Cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of co-administration is recommended, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment.  \n    Patients who are taking sofosbuvir in combination with OLYSIO who need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.\n \n\n Due to amiodarone's long elimination half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting sofosbuvir in combination with OLYSIO should also undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.\n\n\n\n Patients who develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia should seek medical evaluation immediately. Symptoms may include near-fainting or fainting, dizziness or lightheadedness, malaise, weakness, excessive tiredness, shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion or memory problems [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  and  Drug Interactions (7.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Hepatic Decompensation and Hepatic Failure\n\n\n\n   Hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure, including fatal cases, have been reported postmarketing in patients treated with OLYSIO in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin or in combination with sofosbuvir. Most cases were reported in patients with advanced and/or decompensated cirrhosis who are at increased risk for hepatic decompensation or hepatic failure. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between treatment with OLYSIO and these events has not been established [see  Adverse Reactions (6.2)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n  OLYSIO is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C) [see  Dosage and Administration (2.5)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.8)  ].    \n\n\n\n  In clinical trials of OLYSIO, modest increases in bilirubin levels were observed without impacting hepatic function [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Postmarketing cases of hepatic decompensation with markedly elevated bilirubin levels have been reported. Monitor liver chemistry tests before and as clinically indicated during OLYSIO combination therapy. Patients who experience an increase in total bilirubin to greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal should be closely monitored:  \n\n\n\n *   Patients should be instructed to contact their healthcare provider if they have onset of fatigue, weakness, lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, jaundice or discolored feces.  \n *   Discontinue OLYSIO if elevation in bilirubin is accompanied by liver transaminase increases or clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation.  \n       5.3 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Associated With Combination Treatment\n \n\n   OLYSIO should be used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of CHC infection. Therefore, consult the prescribing information for these drugs before starting therapy with OLYSIO. Warnings and Precautions related to these drugs also apply to their use in OLYSIO combination treatment.  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Photosensitivity\n\n\n\n   Photosensitivity reactions have been observed with OLYSIO combination therapy. Serious photosensitivity reactions resulting in hospitalization have been observed with OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Photosensitivity reactions occurred most frequently in the first 4 weeks of treatment, but can occur at any time during treatment.  Photosensitivity may present as an exaggerated sunburn reaction, usually affecting areas exposed to light (typically the face, \"V\" area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, and dorsa of the hands). Manifestations may include burning, erythema, exudation, blistering, and edema.\n\n\n\n  Use sun protective measures and limit sun exposure during treatment with OLYSIO. Avoid use of tanning devices during treatment with OLYSIO.  Discontinuation of OLYSIO should be considered if a photosensitivity reaction occurs and patients should be monitored until the reaction has resolved. If a decision is made to continue OLYSIO in the setting of a photosensitivity reaction, expert consultation is advised.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Rash\n\n\n\n   Rash has been observed with OLYSIO combination therapy [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Rash occurred most frequently in the first 4 weeks of treatment, but can occur at any time during treatment. Severe rash and rash requiring discontinuation of OLYSIO have been reported in subjects receiving OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV.  Most of the rash events in OLYSIO-treated patients were of mild or moderate severity [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Patients with mild to moderate rashes should be followed for possible progression of rash, including the development of mucosal signs (e.g., oral lesions, conjunctivitis) or systemic symptoms. If the rash becomes severe, OLYSIO should be discontinued. Patients should be monitored until the rash has resolved.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Sulfa Allergy\n\n\n\n  OLYSIO contains a sulfonamide moiety. In subjects with a history of sulfa allergy (n=16), no increased incidence of rash or photosensitivity reactions has been observed. However, there are insufficient data to exclude an association between sulfa allergy and the frequency or severity of adverse reactions observed with the use of OLYSIO.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Drug Interactions\n\n\n\n   Co-administration of OLYSIO with substances that are moderate or strong inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) is not recommended as this may lead to significantly lower or higher exposure of simeprevir, respectively, which may result in reduced therapeutic effect or adverse reactions [see  Drug Interactions (7)  and  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  .  \n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Hepatic injury: monitor liver function tests; monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatic injury; consider discontinuation of PLEGRIDY if hepatic injury occurs (  5.1  ) \n *  Depression and suicide: advise patients to report immediately any symptom of depression or suicidal ideation to their healthcare provider; consider discontinuation of PLEGRIDY if depression occurs (  5.2  ) \n *  Seizure: Seizures are associated with the use of interferon beta. Exercise caution when administering PLEGRIDY to patients with a seizure disorder (  5.3  ) \n *  Anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions: serious allergic reactions have been reported as a rare complication of treatment with interferon beta. Discontinue PLEGRIDY if a serious allergic reaction occurs (  5.4  ) \n *  Injection site reactions: change injection site or consider discontinuation of PLEGRIDY if there is necrosis (  5.5  ) \n *  Congestive heart failure: monitor patients with pre-existing significant cardiac disease for worsening of cardiac symptoms (  5.6  ) \n *  Decreased peripheral blood counts: monitor complete blood counts (  5.7  ) \n *  Autoimmune disorders: consider discontinuation of PLEGRIDY if a new autoimmune disorder occurs (  5.8  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hepatic Injury\n\n\n\n  Severe hepatic injury, including hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and rare cases of severe hepatic failure, have been reported with interferon beta. Asymptomatic elevation of hepatic transaminases has also been reported, and in some patients has recurred upon rechallenge with interferon beta.\n\n\n\n Elevations in hepatic enzymes and hepatic injury have been observed with the use of PLEGRIDY in clinical studies. The incidence of increases in hepatic transaminases was greater in patients taking PLEGRIDY than in those taking placebo. The incidence of elevations of alanine aminotransferase above 5 times the upper limit of normal was 1% in placebo-treated patients and 2% in PLEGRIDY-treated patients. The incidence of elevations of aspartate aminotransferase above 5 times the upper limit of normal was less than 1% in placebo-treated patients and less than 1% in PLEGRIDY-treated patients. Elevations of serum hepatic transaminases combined with elevated bilirubin occurred in 2 patients. Both cases resolved following discontinuation of PLEGRIDY.\n\n\n\n Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatic injury.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Depression and Suicide\n\n\n\n  Depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide occur more frequently in patients receiving interferon beta than in patients receiving placebo.\n\n\n\n In clinical studies, the overall incidence of adverse events related to depression and suicidal ideation in multiple sclerosis patients was 8% in both the PLEGRIDY and placebo groups. The incidence of serious events related to depression and suicidal ideation was similar and less than 1% in both groups.\n\n\n\n Advise patients to report immediately any symptom of depression or suicidal ideation to their healthcare provider. If a patient develops depression or other severe psychiatric symptoms, consider stopping treatment with PLEGRIDY.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Seizures\n\n\n\n  Seizures are associated with the use of interferon beta.\n\n\n\n The incidence of seizures in multiple sclerosis clinical studies was less than 1% in patients receiving PLEGRIDY and placebo.\n\n\n\n Exercise caution when administering PLEGRIDY to patients with a seizure disorder.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Anaphylaxis and Other Allergic Reactions\n\n\n\n  Anaphylaxis and other serious allergic reactions are rare complications of treatment with interferon beta.\n\n\n\n Less than 1% of PLEGRIDY-treated patients experienced a serious allergic reaction such as angioedema or urticaria. Those who did have serious allergic reactions recovered promptly after treatment with antihistamines or corticosteroids.\n\n\n\n Discontinue PLEGRIDY if a serious allergic reaction occurs.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Injection Site Reactions\n\n\n\n  Injection site reactions, including injection site necrosis, can occur with the use of subcutaneous interferon beta.\n\n\n\n In clinical studies, the incidence of injection site reactions (e.g., injection site erythema, pain, pruritus, or edema) was 66% in the PLEGRIDY group and 11% in the placebo group; the incidence of severe injection site reactions was 3% in the PLEGRIDY group and 0% in the placebo group. One patient out of 1468 patients who received PLEGRIDY in clinical studies experienced injection site necrosis. The injury resolved with standard medical treatment.\n\n\n\n Decisions to discontinue therapy following necrosis at a single injection site should be based on the extent of the necrosis. For patients who continue therapy with PLEGRIDY after injection site necrosis has occurred, avoid administration of PLEGRIDY near the affected area until it is fully healed. If multiple lesions occur, discontinue PLEGRIDY until healing occurs.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Congestive Heart Failure\n\n\n\n  Congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure occur in patients receiving interferon beta.\n\n\n\n In clinical studies, the incidence of cardiovascular events was 7% in both PLEGRIDY and placebo treatment groups. No serious cardiovascular events were reported in the PLEGRIDY group.\n\n\n\n Monitor patients with significant cardiac disease for worsening of their cardiac condition during initiation and continuation of treatment with PLEGRIDY.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Decreased Peripheral Blood Counts\n\n\n\n  Interferon beta can cause decreased peripheral blood counts in all cell lines, including rare instances of pancytopenia and severe thrombocytopenia.\n\n\n\n In clinical studies, decreases in white blood cell counts below 3.0 x 10  9  /L occurred in 7% of patients receiving PLEGRIDY and in 1% receiving placebo. There is no apparent association between decreases in white blood cell counts and an increased risk of infections or serious infections. The incidence of clinically significant decreases in lymphocyte counts (below 0.5 x 10  9  /L), neutrophil counts (below 1.0 x 10  9  /L), and platelet counts (below 100 x 10  9  /L) were all less than 1% and similar in both placebo and PLEGRIDY groups. Two serious cases were reported in patients treated with PLEGRIDY: one patient (less than 1%) experienced severe thrombocytopenia (defined as a platelet count less than or equal to 10 x 10  9  /L), and another patient (less than 1%) experienced severe neutropenia (defined as a neutrophil count less than or equal to 0.5 x 10  9  /L). In both patients, cell counts recovered after discontinuation of PLEGRIDY. Compared to placebo, there were no significant differences in red blood cell counts in patients treated with PLEGRIDY.\n\n\n\n Monitor patients for infections, bleeding, and symptoms of anemia. Monitor complete blood cell counts, differential white blood cell counts, and platelet counts during treatment with PLEGRIDY. Patients with myelosuppression may require more intensive monitoring of blood cell counts.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Autoimmune Disorders\n\n\n\n  Autoimmune disorders of multiple target organs including idiopathic thrombocytopenia, hyper- and hypothyroidism, and autoimmune hepatitis have been reported with interferon beta.\n\n\n\n In clinical studies, the incidence of autoimmune disorders was less than 1% in both PLEGRIDY and placebo treatment groups.\n\n\n\n If patients develop a new autoimmune disorder, consider stopping PLEGRIDY.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Decreased efficacy among patients treated for skin and skin structure infections with moderate/severe pre-existing renal impairment: Consider these data when selecting antibacterial therapy for patients with baseline CrCl <=50 mL/min. (  5.2  ) \n *  Hypersensitivity reactions: Serious and potentially fatal hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, may occur after first or subsequent doses. VIBATIV should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to vancomycin. (  5.6  ,  6.2  ) \n *  Infusion-related reactions: Administer VIBATIV over at least 60 minutes to minimize infusion-related reactions. (  5.7  ) \n *   Clostridium difficile -associated disease: May range from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (  5.8  ) \n *  Coagulation test interference: Telavancin interferes with some laboratory coagulation tests, including prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and activated partial thromboplastin time. (  5.5  ,  7.1  ) \n *  QTc prolongation: Avoid use in patients at risk. Use with caution in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. (  5.10  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Increased Mortality in Patients with HABP/VABP and Pre-existing Moderate to Severe Renal Impairment (CrCl<=50 mL/min)\n\n\n\n  In the analysis of patients (classified by the treatment received) in the two combined HABP/VABP trials with pre-existing moderate/severe renal impairment (CrCl<=50 mL/min), all-cause mortality within 28 days of starting treatment was 95/241 (39%) in the VIBATIV group, compared with 72/243 (30%) in the vancomycin group.  All-cause mortality at 28 days in patients without pre-existing moderate/severe renal impairment (CrCl>50 mL/min) was 86/510 (17%) in the VIBATIV group and 92/510 (18%) in the vancomycin group. Therefore, VIBATIV use in patients with baseline CrCl<=50 mL/min should be considered only when the anticipated benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk [see Adverse Reactions, Clinical Trials Experience (  6.1  )  and Clinical Trials, HABP/VABP (  14.2  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.2 Decreased Clinical Response in Patients with cSSSI and Pre-existing Moderate/Severe Renal Impairment (CrCl<=50 mL/min)\n\n\n\n  In a subgroup analysis of the combined cSSSI trials,clinical cure rates in the VIBATIV-treated patients were lower in patients with baseline CrCl <=50 mL/min compared with those with CrCl>50 mL/min (  Table 2  ). A decrease of this magnitude was not observed in vancomycin-treated patients. Consider these data when selecting antibacterial therapy for use in patients with cSSSI and with baseline moderate/severe renal impairment.\n\n\n\n Table 2: Clinical Cure by Pre-existing Renal Impairment - Clinically Evaluable Population \n                           VIBATIV% (n/N)                          Vancomycin% (n/N)                       \n  cSSSI Trials                                                                                             \n CrCl>50 mL/min           87.0% (520/598)                         85.9% (524/610)                          \n CrCl <=50 mL/min         67.4% (58/86)                           82.7% (67/81)                            \n            5.3 Nephrotoxicity\n \n\n  In both the HABP/VABP trials and the cSSSI trials, renal adverse events were more likely to occur in patients with baseline comorbidities known to predispose patients to kidney dysfunction (pre-existing renal disease, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, or hypertension). The renal adverse event rates were also higher in patients who received concomitant medications known to affect kidney function (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ACE inhibitors, and loop diuretics).\n\n\n\n Monitor renal function (i.e., serum creatinine, creatinine clearance) in all patients receiving VIBATIV. Values should be obtained prior to initiation of treatment, during treatment (at 48- to 72-hour intervals or more frequently, if clinically indicated), and at the end of therapy. If renal function decreases, the benefit of continuing VIBATIV versus discontinuing and initiating therapy with an alternative agent should be assessed [see Dosage and Administration (  2  ), Adverse Reactions (  6  ),  and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )  ].\n\n\n\n In patients with renal dysfunction, accumulation of the solubilizer hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin can occur [see Patients with Renal Impairment (  8.6  )  and Clinical Pharmacology (  12.3  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.4 Pregnant Women and Women of Childbearing Potential\n\n\n\n  Avoid use of VIBATIV during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. VIBATIV caused adverse developmental outcomes in 3 animal species at clinically relevant doses. This raises concern about potential adverse developmental outcomes in humans.\n\n\n\n Women of childbearing potential should have a serum pregnancy test prior to administration of VIBATIV. If not already pregnant, women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during VIBATIV treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.5 Coagulation Test Interference\n\n\n\n  Although telavancin does not interfere with coagulation, it interfered with certain tests used to monitor coagulation (  Table 3  ), when conducted using samples drawn 0 to 18 hours after VIBATIV administration for patients being treated once every 24 hours. Blood samples for these coagulation tests should be collected as close as possible prior to a patient's next dose of VIBATIV. Blood samples for coagulation tests unaffected by VIBATIV may be collected at any time [see Drug Interactions (  7.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n For patients who require aPTT monitoring while being treated with VIBATIV, a non phospholipid dependent coagulation test such as a Factor Xa (chromogenic) assay or an alternative anticoagulant not requiring aPTT monitoring may be considered.\n\n\n\n Table 3: Coagulation Tests Affected and Unaffected by Telavancin \n\n  Affected by Telavancin                                    Unaffected by Telavancin\n \n Prothrombin time/international                           Thrombin time\n normalized ratio                                         Whole blood (Lee-White) clotting time\n Activated partial thromboplastin time                    Platelet aggregation study\n Activated clotting time                                  Chromogenic anti-factor Xa assay\n Coagulation based factor X activity assay                Functional (chromogenic) factor X activity assay\n                                                          Bleeding time\n                                                          D-dimer\n                                                          Fibrin degradation products\n\n\n        No evidence of increased bleeding risk has been observed in clinical trials with VIBATIV. Telavancin has no effect on platelet aggregation. Furthermore, no evidence of hypercoagulability has been seen, as healthy subjects receiving VIBATIV have normal levels of D-dimer and fibrin degradation products.\n \n\n    5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, may occur after first or subsequent doses. Discontinue VIBATIV at first sign of skin rash, or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Telavancin is a semi-synthetic derivative of vancomycin; it is unknown if patients with hypersensitivity reactions to vancomycin will experience cross-reactivity to telavancin. VIBATIV should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to vancomycin [see Postmarketing Experience (  6.2  )  ].\n\n\n\n    5.7 Infusion-Related Reactions\n\n\n\n  VIBATIV is a lipoglycopeptide antibacterial agent and should be administered over a period of 60 minutes to reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions. Rapid intravenous infusions of the glycopeptide class of antimicrobial agents can cause \"Red-man Syndrome\"-like reactions including: flushing of the upper body, urticaria, pruritus, or rash. Stopping or slowing the infusion may result in cessation of these reactions.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Clostridium difficile  -Associated Diarrhea\n\n\n\n   Clostridium difficile-  associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile  .\n\n\n\n  C. difficile  produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hyper-toxin-producing strains of C. difficile  cause increased morbidity and mortality, since these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.\n\n\n\n If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile  may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile  , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.\n\n\n\n    5.9 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria\n\n\n\n  Prescribing VIBATIV in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.\n\n\n\n As with other antibacterial drugs, use of VIBATIV may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. Patients should be carefully monitored during therapy. If superinfection occurs, appropriate measures should be taken.\n\n\n\n    5.10 QTc Prolongation\n\n\n\n  In a study involving healthy volunteers, doses of 7.5 and 15 mg/kg of VIBATIV prolonged the QTc interval [see Clinical Pharmacology (  12.2  )  ]. Caution is warranted when prescribing VIBATIV to patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Patients with congenital long QT syndrome, known prolongation of the QTc interval, uncompensated heart failure, or severe left ventricular hypertrophy were not included in clinical trials of VIBATIV. Use of VIBATIV should be avoided in patients with these conditions.\n",

Measure liver chemistries before the initiation of treatment and regularly during treatment. (  5.1  ) \n *    Prolonged QT intervals and torsades de pointes have been observed. Use with caution in patients at higher risk of developing QT interval prolongation. Monitoring electrocardiograms and electrolytes should be considered. (  5.2  ) \n *    Cardiac dysfunction such as congestive heart failure and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) have occurred. Monitor blood pressure and manage hypertension promptly. Baseline and periodic evaluation of LVEF is recommended in patients at risk of cardiac dysfunction. (  5.3  ) \n *    Fatal hemorrhagic events have been reported. VOTRIENT has not been studied in patients who have a history of hemoptysis, cerebral, or clinically significant gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the past 6 months and should not be used in those patients. (  5.4  ) \n *    Arterial thromboembolic events have been observed and can be fatal. Use with caution in patients who are at increased risk for these events. (  5.5  ) \n *    Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) have been observed, including fatal pulmonary emboli (PE). Monitor for signs and symptoms of VTE and PE. (  5.6  ) \n *    Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) has been observed. Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT if TMA occurs. (  5.7  ) \n *    Gastrointestinal perforation or fistula has occurred. Fatal perforation events have occurred. Use with caution in patients at risk for gastrointestinal perforation or fistula. (  5.8  ) \n *    Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis have been observed and can be fatal. Discontinue VOTRIENT in patients developing ILD or pneumonitis. (  5.9  ) \n *    Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has been observed and can be fatal. Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT in patients developing RPLS. (  5.10  ) \n *    Hypertension including hypertensive crisis has been observed. Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating VOTRIENT. Monitor blood pressure within one week after starting VOTRIENT and frequently thereafter. (  5.11  ) \n *    Interruption of therapy with VOTRIENT is recommended in patients undergoing surgical procedures. (  5.12  ) \n *    Hypothyroidism may occur. Monitoring of thyroid function tests is recommended. (  5.13  ) \n *    Proteinuria: Monitor urine protein. Interrupt treatment for 24-hour urine protein >=3 grams and discontinue for repeat episodes despite dose reductions. (  5.14  ) \n *    Infection: Serious infections (with or without neutropenia), some with fatal outcome, have been reported. Monitor for signs and symptoms and treat active infection promptly. Interrupt or discontinue VOTRIENT. (  5.15  ) \n *    Animal studies have demonstrated VOTRIENT can severely affect organ growth and maturation during early post-natal development. The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. (  5.17  ) \n *    VOTRIENT can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while taking VOTRIENT. (  5.18  ,  8.1  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hepatic Toxicity and Hepatic Impairment\n\n\n\n  In clinical trials with VOTRIENT, hepatotoxicity, manifested as increases in serum transaminases (ALT, AST) and bilirubin, was observed. This hepatotoxicity can be severe and fatal. Patients older than 65 years are at greater risk for hepatotoxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]  .  Transaminase elevations occur early in the course of treatment (92.5% of all transaminase elevations of any grade occurred in the first 18 weeks) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  .\n\n\n\n In the randomized RCC trial, ALT >3 X ULN was reported in 18% and 3% of the groups receiving VOTRIENT and placebo, respectively. ALT >10 X ULN was reported in 4% of patients who received VOTRIENT and in <1% of patients who received placebo. Concurrent elevation in ALT >3 X ULN and bilirubin >2 X ULN in the absence of significant alkaline phosphatase >3 X ULN occurred in 2% (5/290) of patients on VOTRIENT and 1% (2/145) on placebo.\n\n\n\n In the randomized STS trial, ALT >3 X ULN was reported in 18% and 5% of the groups receiving VOTRIENT and placebo, respectively. ALT >8 X ULN was reported in 5% and 2% of the groups receiving VOTRIENT and placebo, respectively. Concurrent elevation in ALT >3 X ULN and bilirubin >2 X ULN in the absence of significant alkaline phosphatase >3 X ULN occurred in 2% (4/240) of patients on VOTRIENT and <1% (1/123) on placebo.\n\n\n\n Two-tenths percent of the patients (2/977) from trials that supported the RCC indication died with disease progression and hepatic failure and 0.4% of patients (1/240) in the randomized STS trial died of hepatic failure.\n\n\n\n *    Monitor serum liver tests before initiation of treatment with VOTRIENT and at Weeks 3, 5, 7, and 9. Thereafter, monitor at Month 3 and at Month 4, and as clinically indicated. Periodic monitoring should then continue after Month 4. \n *    Patients with isolated ALT elevations between 3 X ULN and 8 X ULN may be continued on VOTRIENT with weekly monitoring of liver function until ALT returns to Grade 1 or baseline. \n *    Patients with isolated ALT elevations of >8 X ULN should have VOTRIENT interrupted until they return to Grade 1 or baseline. If the potential benefit for reinitiating treatment with VOTRIENT is considered to outweigh the risk for hepatotoxicity, then reintroduce VOTRIENT at a reduced dose of no more than 400 mg once daily and measure serum liver tests weekly for 8 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Following reintroduction of VOTRIENT, if ALT elevations >3 X ULN recur, then VOTRIENT should be permanently discontinued. \n *    If ALT elevations >3 X ULN occur concurrently with bilirubin elevations >2 X ULN, VOTRIENT should be permanently discontinued. Patients should be monitored until resolution. VOTRIENT is a uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) inhibitor. Mild, indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia may occur in patients with Gilbert's syndrome [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] . Patients with only a mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia, known Gilbert's syndrome, and elevation in ALT >3 X ULN should be managed as per the recommendations outlined for isolated ALT elevations. \n    Concomitant use of VOTRIENT and simvastatin increases the risk of ALT elevations and should be undertaken with caution and close monitoring [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]  . Insufficient data are available to assess the risk of concomitant administration of alternative statins and VOTRIENT.\n \n\n In patients with pre-existing moderate hepatic impairment, the starting dose of VOTRIENT should be reduced or alternatives to VOTRIENT should be considered. Treatment with VOTRIENT is not recommended in patients with pre-existing severe hepatic impairment, defined as total bilirubin >3 X ULN with any level of ALT [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes\n\n\n\n  In the RCC trials of VOTRIENT, QT prolongation (>=500 msec) was identified on routine electrocardiogram monitoring in 2% (11/558) of patients. Torsades de pointes occurred in <1% (2/977) of patients who received VOTRIENT in the monotherapy trials.\n\n\n\n In the randomized RCC and STS trials, 1% (3/290) of patients and 0.4% (1/240) of patients, respectively, who received VOTRIENT had post-baseline values between 500 to 549 msec. Post-baseline QT data were only collected in the STS trial if ECG abnormalities were reported as an adverse reaction. None of the 268 patients who received placebo on the two trials had post-baseline QTc values >=500 msec.\n\n\n\n VOTRIENT should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, in patients taking antiarrhythmics or other medications that may prolong QT interval, and those with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease. When using VOTRIENT, baseline and periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and maintenance of electrolytes (e.g., calcium, magnesium, potassium) within the normal range should be performed.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Cardiac Dysfunction\n\n\n\n  In clinical trials with VOTRIENT, events of cardiac dysfunction such as decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and congestive heart failure have occurred. In the overall safety population for RCC (N = 586), cardiac dysfunction was observed in 0.6% (4/586) of patients without routine on-study LVEF monitoring. In a randomized RCC trial of VOTRIENT compared with sunitinib, myocardial dysfunction was defined as symptoms of cardiac dysfunction or >=15% absolute decline in LVEF compared with baseline or a decline in LVEF of >=10% compared with baseline that is also below the lower limit of normal. In patients who had baseline and follow up LVEF measurements, myocardial dysfunction occurred in 13% (47/362) of patients on VOTRIENT compared with 11% (42/369) of patients on sunitinib. Congestive heart failure occurred in 0.5% of patients on each arm.   In the randomized STS trial, myocardial dysfunction occurred in 11% (16/142) of patients on VOTRIENT compared with 5% (2/40) of patients on placebo. One percent (3/240) of patients on VOTRIENT in the STS trial had congestive heart failure which did not resolve in one patient.\n\n\n\n Fourteen of the 16 patients with myocardial dysfunction treated with VOTRIENT in the STS trial had concurrent hypertension which may have exacerbated cardiac dysfunction in patients at risk (e.g., those with prior anthracycline therapy) possibly by increasing cardiac afterload. Blood pressure should be monitored and managed promptly using a combination of anti-hypertensive therapy and dose modification of VOTRIENT (interruption and re-initiation at a reduced dose based on clinical judgment) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]  . Patients should be carefully monitored for clinical signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure. Baseline and periodic evaluation of LVEF is recommended in patients at risk of cardiac dysfunction including previous anthracycline exposure.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Hemorrhagic Events\n\n\n\n  Fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.9% (5/586) in the RCC trials; there were no reports of fatal hemorrhage in the STS trials. In the randomized RCC trial, 13% (37/290) of patients treated with VOTRIENT and 5% (7/145) of patients on placebo experienced at least 1 hemorrhagic event. The most common hemorrhagic events in the patients treated with VOTRIENT were hematuria (4%), epistaxis (2%), hemoptysis (2%), and rectal hemorrhage (1%). Nine of 37 patients treated with VOTRIENT who had hemorrhagic events experienced serious events including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary hemorrhage. One percent (4/290) of patients treated with VOTRIENT died from hemorrhage compared with no (0/145) patients on placebo. In the overall safety population in RCC (N = 586), cerebral/intracranial hemorrhage was observed in <1% (2/586) of patients treated with VOTRIENT.\n\n\n\n In the randomized STS trial, 22% (53/240) of patients treated with VOTRIENT compared with 8% (10/123) treated with placebo experienced at least 1 hemorrhagic event. The most common hemorrhagic events were epistaxis (8%), mouth hemorrhage (3%), and anal hemorrhage (2%). Grade 4 hemorrhagic events in the STS population occurred in 1% (3/240) of patients and included intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and peritoneal hemorrhage.\n\n\n\n VOTRIENT has not been studied in patients who have a history of hemoptysis, cerebral hemorrhage, or clinically significant gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the past 6 months and should not be used in those patients.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Arterial Thromboembolic Events\n\n\n\n  Fatal arterial thromboembolic events were observed in 0.3% (2/586) of patients in the RCC trials and in no patients in the STS trials. In the randomized RCC trial, 2% (5/290) of patients receiving VOTRIENT experienced myocardial infarction or ischemia, 0.3% (1/290) had a cerebrovascular accident, and 1% (4/290) had an event of transient ischemic attack. In the randomized STS trial, 2% (4/240) of patients receiving VOTRIENT experienced a myocardial infarction or ischemia, 0.4% (1/240) had a cerebrovascular accident and there were no incidents of transient ischemic attack. No arterial thromboembolic events were reported in patients who received placebo in either trial. VOTRIENT should be used with caution in patients who are at increased risk for these events or who have had a history of these events. VOTRIENT has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months and should not be used in those patients.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Venous Thromboembolic Events\n\n\n\n  In RCC and STS trials of VOTRIENT, venous thromboembolic events (VTE) including venous thrombosis and fatal pulmonary embolus (PE) have occurred. In the randomized STS trial, venous thromboembolic events were reported in 5% of patients treated with VOTRIENT compared with 2% with placebo. In the randomized RCC trial, the rate was 1% in both arms. Fatal pulmonary embolus occurred in 1% (2/240) of STS patients receiving VOTRIENT and in no patients receiving placebo. There were no fatal pulmonary emboli in the RCC trial. Monitor for signs and symptoms of VTE and PE.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Thrombotic Microangiopathy\n\n\n\n  Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), has been reported in clinical trials of VOTRIENT as monotherapy, in combination with bevacizumab, and in combination with topotecan. VOTRIENT is not indicated for use in combination with other agents. Six of the 7 TMA cases occurred within 90 days of the initiation of VOTRIENT. Improvement of TMA was observed after treatment was discontinued. Monitor for signs and symptoms of TMA. Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT in patients developing TMA. Manage as clinically indicated.\n\n\n\n    5.8 Gastrointestinal Perforation and Fistula\n\n\n\n  In the RCC and STS trials, gastrointestinal perforation or fistula occurred in 0.9% (5/586) of patients and 1% (4/382) of patients receiving VOTRIENT, respectively. Fatal perforations occurred in 0.3% (2/586) of these patients in the RCC trials and in 0.3% (1/382) of these patients in the STS trials. Monitor for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula.\n\n\n\n    5.9 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis\n\n\n\n   ILD/pneumonitis, which can be fatal, has been reported in association with VOTRIENT. In clinical trials, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 0.1% of patients treated with VOTRIENT.  \n\n\n\n  Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis and discontinue VOTRIENT in patients developing ILD or pneumonitis.  \n\n\n\n    5.10 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome\n\n\n\n  Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has been reported in patients receiving VOTRIENT and may be fatal.\n\n\n\n RPLS is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. The diagnosis of RPLS is optimally confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Permanently discontinue VOTRIENT in patients developing RPLS.\n\n\n\n    5.11 Hypertension\n\n\n\n  In clinical trials, hypertension (systolic blood pressure >=150 or diastolic blood pressure >=100 mm Hg) and hypertensive crisis were observed in patients treated with VOTRIENT. Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating VOTRIENT. Hypertension occurs early in the course of treatment (40% of cases occurred by Day 9 and 90% of cases occurred in the first 18 weeks). Blood pressure should be monitored early after starting treatment (no longer than one week) and frequently thereafter to ensure blood pressure control. Approximately 40% of patients who received VOTRIENT experienced hypertension. Grade 3 hypertension was reported in 4% to 7% of patients receiving VOTRIENT [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .\n\n\n\n Increased blood pressure should be treated promptly with standard anti-hypertensive therapy and dose reduction or interruption of VOTRIENT as clinically warranted. VOTRIENT should be discontinued if there is evidence of hypertensive crisis or if hypertension is severe and persistent despite anti-hypertensive therapy and dose reduction. Approximately 1% of patients required permanent discontinuation of VOTRIENT because of hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.12 Wound Healing\n\n\n\n  No formal trials on the effect of VOTRIENT on wound healing have been conducted. Since vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors such as pazopanib may impair wound healing, treatment with VOTRIENT should be stopped at least 7 days prior to scheduled surgery. The decision to resume VOTRIENT after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. VOTRIENT should be discontinued in patients with wound dehiscence.\n\n\n\n    5.13 Hypothyroidism\n\n\n\n  Hypothyroidism, confirmed based on a simultaneous rise of TSH and decline of T4, was reported in 7% (19/290) of patients treated with VOTRIENT in the randomized RCC trial and in 5% (11/240) of patients treated with VOTRIENT in the randomized STS trial. No patients on the placebo arm of either trial had hypothyroidism. In RCC and STS trials of VOTRIENT, hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse reaction in 4% (26/586) and 5% (20/382) of patients, respectively. Proactive monitoring of thyroid function tests is recommended.\n\n\n\n    5.14 Proteinuria\n\n\n\n  In the randomized RCC trial, proteinuria was reported as an adverse reaction in 9% (27/290) of patients receiving VOTRIENT and in no patients receiving placebo. In 2 patients, proteinuria led to discontinuation of treatment with VOTRIENT. In the randomized STS trial, proteinuria was reported as an adverse reaction in 1% (2/240) of patients, and nephrotic syndrome was reported in 1 patient treated with VOTRIENT compared with none in patients receiving placebo. Treatment was withdrawn in the patient with nephrotic syndrome.\n\n\n\n Baseline and periodic urinalysis during treatment is recommended with follow up measurement of 24-hour urine protein as clinically indicated. Interrupt VOTRIENT and dose reduce for 24-hour urine protein >=3 grams; discontinue VOTRIENT for repeat episodes despite dose reductions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.15 Infection\n\n\n\n  Serious infections (with or without neutropenia), including some with fatal outcome, have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection. Institute appropriate anti-infective therapy promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation of VOTRIENT for serious infections.\n\n\n\n    5.16 Increased Toxicity with Other Cancer Therapy\n\n\n\n  VOTRIENT is not indicated for use in combination with other agents. Clinical trials of VOTRIENT in combination with pemetrexed and lapatinib were terminated early due to concerns over increased toxicity and mortality. The fatal toxicities observed included pulmonary hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and sudden death. A safe and effective combination dose has not been established with these regimens.\n\n\n\n    5.17 Increased Toxicity in Developing Organs\n\n\n\n  The safety and effectiveness of VOTRIENT in pediatric patients have not been established. VOTRIENT is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Based on its mechanism of action, pazopanib may have severe effects on organ growth and maturation during early post-natal development. Administration of pazopanib to juvenile rats less than 21 days old resulted in toxicity to the lungs, liver, heart, and kidney and in death at doses significantly lower than the clinically recommended dose or doses tolerated in older animals. VOTRIENT may potentially cause serious adverse effects on organ development in pediatric patients, particularly in patients younger than 2 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]  .\n\n\n\n    5.18 Pregnancy\n\n\n\n  VOTRIENT can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on its mechanism of action, VOTRIENT is expected to result in adverse reproductive effects. In pre-clinical studies in rats and rabbits, pazopanib was teratogenic, embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and abortifacient.\n\n\n\n There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of VOTRIENT in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while taking VOTRIENT [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]  .\n",

(  5.1  ) \n *  Risk of Infection: Assess patients for signs and symptoms of infection and initiate appropriate treatment promptly. Serious infections should have resolved before starting therapy with Jakafi. (  5.2  ) \n *  Symptom Exacerbation Following Interruption or Discontinuation: Manage with supportive care and consider resuming treatment with Jakafi. (  5.3  ) \n *  Risk of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer (  5.4  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Thrombocytopenia, Anemia and Neutropenia\n\n\n\n  Treatment with Jakafi can cause thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia. [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n Manage thrombocytopenia by reducing the dose or temporarily interrupting Jakafi. Platelet transfusions may be necessary [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.1.1  ), and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n Patients developing anemia may require blood transfusions and/or dose modifications of Jakafi.\n\n\n\n Severe neutropenia (ANC less than 0.5 X 10  9  /L) was generally reversible by withholding Jakafi until recovery [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n Perform a pre-treatment complete blood count (CBC) and monitor CBCs every 2 to 4 weeks until doses are stabilized, and then as clinically indicated. [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.1.1  ), and Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].\n\n\n\n     5.2 Risk of Infection  \n\n\n\n   Serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections have occurred. Delay starting therapy with Jakafi until active serious infections have resolved. Observe patients receiving Jakafi for signs and symptoms of infection and manage promptly.  \n\n\n\n  Tuberculosis  \n\n\n\n  Tuberculosis infection has been reported in patients receiving Jakafi. Observe patients receiving Jakafi for signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis and manage promptly.  \n\n\n\n  Prior to initiating Jakafi, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors, and those at higher risk should be tested for latent infection. Risk factors include, but are not limited to, prior residence in or travel to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, close contact with a person with active tuberculosis, and a history of active or latent tuberculosis where an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed.  \n\n\n\n  For patients with evidence of active or latent tuberculosis, consult a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis before starting Jakafi. The decision to continue Jakafi during treatment of active tuberculosis should be based on the overall risk-benefit determination.  \n\n\n\n  PML  \n\n\n\n  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has occurred with ruxolitinib treatment for myelofibrosis. If PML is suspected, stop Jakafi and evaluate.  \n\n\n\n  Herpes Zoster  \n\n\n\n  Advise patients about early signs and symptoms of herpes zoster and to seek treatment as early as possible if suspected [ see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )  ].  \n\n\n\n     5.3 Symptom Exacerbation Following Interruption or Discontinuation of Treatment with Jakafi  \n\n\n\n   Following discontinuation of Jakafi, symptoms from myeloproliferative neoplasms may return to pretreatment levels over a period of approximately one week. Some patients with myelofibrosis have experienced one or more of the following adverse events after discontinuing Jakafi: fever, respiratory distress, hypotension, DIC, or multi-organ failure. If one or more of these occur after discontinuation of, or while tapering the dose of Jakafi, evaluate for and treat any intercurrent illness and consider restarting or increasing the dose of Jakafi. Instruct patients not to interrupt or discontinue Jakafi therapy without consulting their physician. When discontinuing or interrupting therapy with Jakafi for reasons other than thrombocytopenia or neutropenia [ see Dosage and Administration (  2.5  )  ], consider tapering the dose of Jakafi gradually rather than discontinuing abruptly.  \n\n\n\n     5.4 Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer  \n\n\n\n   Non-melanoma skin cancers including basal cell, squamous cell, and Merkel cell carcinoma have occurred in patients treated with Jakafi. Perform periodic skin examinations.  \n",

Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT3receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.  \n\n\n\n Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, and hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).  Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of AKYNZEO and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue AKYNZEO and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if AKYNZEO is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (   7   ), Patient Counseling Information (   17   )]  .\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *   ALT Elevations : Discontinue ethinyl estradiol-containing medications prior to starting VIEKIRA PAK (alternative contraceptive methods are recommended). Perform hepatic laboratory testing on all patients during the first 4 weeks of treatment. For ALT elevations on VIEKIRA PAK, monitor closely and follow recommendations in full prescribing information. (  5.1  ) \n *   Risks Associated With Ribavirin Combination Treatment : If VIEKIRA PAK is administered with ribavirin, the warnings and precautions for ribavirin also apply to this combination regimen. (  5.2  ) \n *   Drug Interactions : The concomitant use of VIEKIRA PAK and certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of VIEKIRA PAK. (  5.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Increased Risk of ALT Elevations\n\n\n\n  During clinical trials with VIEKIRA PAK with or without ribavirin, elevations of ALT to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in approximately 1% of all subjects [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . ALT elevations were typically asymptomatic, occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment, and declined within two to eight weeks of onset with continued dosing of VIEKIRA PAK with or without ribavirin.\n\n\n\n These ALT elevations were significantly more frequent in female subjects who were using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications such as combined oral contraceptives, contraceptive patches or contraceptive vaginal rings. Ethinyl estradiol-containing medications must be discontinued prior to starting therapy with VIEKIRA PAK [see Contraindications (  4  )]  . Alternative methods of contraception (e.g, progestin only contraception or non-hormonal methods) are recommended during VIEKIRA PAK therapy. Ethinyl estradiol-containing medications can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with VIEKIRA PAK.\n\n\n\n Women using estrogens other than ethinyl estradiol, such as estradiol and conjugated estrogens used in hormone replacement therapy had a rate of ALT elevation similar to those not receiving any estrogens; however, due to the limited number of subjects taking these other estrogens, caution is warranted for co-administration with VIEKIRA PAK [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  .\n\n\n\n Hepatic laboratory testing should be performed during the first 4 weeks of starting treatment and as clinically indicated thereafter. If ALT is found to be elevated above baseline levels, it should be repeated and monitored closely:\n\n\n\n *  Patients should be instructed to consult their health care professional without delay if they have onset of fatigue, weakness, lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, jaundice or discolored feces. \n *  Consider discontinuing VIEKIRA PAK if ALT levels remain persistently greater than 10 times the ULN. \n *  Discontinue VIEKIRA PAK if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation or increasing conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, or INR. \n       5.2 Risks Associated With Ribavirin Combination Treatment\n \n\n  If VIEKIRA PAK is administered with ribavirin, the warnings and precautions for ribavirin, in particular the pregnancy avoidance warning, apply to this combination regimen. Refer to the ribavirin prescribing information for a full list of the warnings and precautions for ribavirin.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Drug Interactions\n\n\n\n  The concomitant use of VIEKIRA PAK and certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to:\n\n\n\n *  Loss of therapeutic effect of VIEKIRA PAK and possible development of resistance \n *  Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs or components of VIEKIRA PAK. \n    See Table 5 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (  7  )]  . Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during VIEKIRA PAK therapy; review concomitant medications during VIEKIRA PAK therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs [see Contraindications (  4  ) and Drug Interactions (  7  )]  .\n \n\n    5.4 Risk of HIV-1 Protease Inhibitor Drug Resistance in HCV/HIV-1 Co-infected Patients\n\n\n\n  The ritonavir component of VIEKIRA PAK is also an HIV-1 protease inhibitor and can select for HIV-1 protease inhibitor resistance-associated substitutions. Any HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients treated with VIEKIRA PAK should also be on a suppressive antiretroviral drug regimen to reduce the risk of HIV-1 protease inhibitor drug resistance.\n",

(  5.1  ,  6.1  ) \n *  Embryo-fetal toxicity: Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. (  5.2  ,  8.1  ) \n *  Infusion-Related Reactions: Monitor for signs and symptoms. If a significant infusion-associated reaction occurs, slow or interrupt the infusion and administer appropriate medical therapies. (  5.3  ) \n *  Hypersensitivity Reactions/Anaphylaxis: Monitor for signs and symptoms. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction/anaphylaxis occurs, discontinue the infusion immediately and administer appropriate medical therapies. (  5.4  ) \n *  HER2 testing: Perform using FDA-approved tests by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency. (  5.5  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Left Ventricular Dysfunction\n\n\n\n  Decreases in LVEF have been reported with drugs that block HER2 activity, including PERJETA. In Study 1, for patients with MBC, PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel was not associated with increases in the incidence of symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) or decreases in LVEF compared with placebo in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel [see  Clinical Studies (14.1)  ]  . Left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 4.4% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 8.3% of patients in the placebo-treated group. Symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (congestive heart failure) occurred in 1.0% of patients in the PERJETA-treated group and 1.8% of patients in the placebo-treated group [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ]  . Patients who have received prior anthracyclines or prior radiotherapy to the chest area may be at higher risk of decreased LVEF.\n\n\n\n In patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment in Study 2, the incidence of LVSD was higher in the PERJETA-treated groups compared to the trastuzumab- and docetaxel-treated group. An increased incidence of LVEF declines was observed in patients treated with PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. In the overall treatment period, LVEF decline > 10% and a drop to less than 50% occurred in 1.9% of patients treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab and docetaxel as compared to 8.4% of patients treated with neoadjuvant PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. Symptomatic LVSD occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with neoadjuvant PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and no patients in the other 3 arms. LVEF recovered to >= 50% in all patients.\n\n\n\n In patients receiving neoadjuvant PERJETA in Study 3, in the overall treatment period, LVEF decline > 10% and a drop to less than 50% occurred in 6.9% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and FEC followed by PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel, 16.0% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC, and 10.5% of patients treated with PERJETA in combination with TCH. Symptomatic LVSD occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC, 1.3% of patients treated with PERJETA in combination with TCH, and none of the patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and FEC followed by PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel. LVEF recovered to >= 50% in all but one patient.\n\n\n\n PERJETA has not been studied in patients with a pretreatment LVEF value of <= 50%, a prior history of CHF, decreases in LVEF to < 50% during prior trastuzumab therapy, or conditions that could impair left ventricular function such as uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment or a cumulative prior anthracycline exposure to > 360 mg/m  2  of doxorubicin or its equivalent.\n\n\n\n Assess LVEF prior to initiation of PERJETA and at regular intervals (e.g., every three months in the metastatic setting and every six weeks in the neoadjuvant setting) during treatment to ensure that LVEF is within the institution's normal limits. If LVEF is < 45%, or is 45% to 49% with a 10% or greater absolute decrease below the pretreatment value, withhold PERJETA and trastuzumab and repeat LVEF assessment within approximately 3 weeks. Discontinue PERJETA and trastuzumab if the LVEF has not improved or has declined further, unless the benefits for the individual patient outweigh the risks [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n   PERJETA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Treatment of pregnant cynomolgus monkeys with pertuzumab resulted in oligohydramnios, delayed fetal kidney development, and embryo-fetal death. If PERJETA is administered during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug or within 7 months following the last dose of PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n  Verify pregnancy status prior to the initiation of PERJETA. Advise patients of the risks of embryo-fetal death and birth defects and the need for contraception during and after treatment. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately if they suspect they may be pregnant. If PERJETA is administered during pregnancy or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving PERJETA or within 7 months following the last dose of PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab, immediately report exposure to the Genentech Adverse Event Line at 1-888-835-2555. Encourage women who may be exposed during pregnancy or within 7 months for PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab prior to conception, to enroll in the MotHER Pregnancy Registry by contacting 1-800-690-6720 [see  Patient Counseling Information (17)  ].    \n\n\n\n Monitor patients who become pregnant during PERJETA therapy for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care. The efficacy of intravenous hydration in the management of oligohydramnios due to PERJETA exposure is not known.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Infusion-Related Reactions\n\n\n\n  PERJETA has been associated with infusion reactions [see  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  An infusion reaction was defined in Study 1 as any event described as hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, acute infusion reaction, or cytokine release syndrome occurring during an infusion or on the same day as the infusion. The initial dose of PERJETA was given the day before trastuzumab and docetaxel to allow for the examination of PERJETA-associated reactions. On the first day, when only PERJETA was administered, the overall frequency of infusion reactions was 13.0% in the PERJETA-treated group and 9.8% in the placebo-treated group. Less than 1% were Grade 3 or 4. The most common infusion reactions (>= 1.0%) were pyrexia, chills, fatigue, headache, asthenia, hypersensitivity, and vomiting.\n\n\n\n During the second cycle when all drugs were administered on the same day, the most common infusion reactions in the PERJETA-treated group (>= 1.0%) were fatigue, dysgeusia, hypersensitivity, myalgia, and vomiting.\n\n\n\n In Study 2 and Study 3, PERJETA was administered on the same day as the other study treatment drugs. Infusion reactions were consistent with those observed in Study 1, with a majority of reactions being National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI - CTCAE v3.0) Grade 1 - 2.\n\n\n\n Observe patients closely for 60 minutes after the first infusion and for 30 minutes after subsequent infusions of PERJETA. If a significant infusion-related reaction occurs, slow or interrupt the infusion, and administer appropriate medical therapies. Monitor patients carefully until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Consider permanent discontinuation in patients with severe infusion reactions [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions/Anaphylaxis\n\n\n\n  In Study 1, the overall frequency of hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions was 10.8% in the PERJETA-treated group and 9.1% in the placebo-treated group. The incidence of Grade 3 - 4 hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions was 2.0% in the PERJETA-treated group and 2.5% in the placebo-treated group according to NCI - CTCAE v3.0. Overall, 4 patients in PERJETA-treated group and 2 patients in the placebo-treated group experienced anaphylaxis.\n\n\n\n In Study 2 and Study 3, hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis events were consistent with those observed in Study 1. In Study 2, two patients in the PERJETA- and docetaxel-treated group experienced anaphylaxis. In Study 3, the overall frequency of hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis was highest in the PERJETA plus TCH treated group (13.2%), of which 2.6% were NCI-CTCAE (version 3) Grade 3 - 4.\n\n\n\n Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions. Severe hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, has been observed in clinical trials with treatment of PERJETA [see  Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)  ]  . Medications to treat such reactions, as well as emergency equipment, should be available for immediate use. PERJETA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to pertuzumab or to any of its excipients [see  Contraindications (4)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.5 HER2 Testing\n\n\n\n  Detection of HER2 protein overexpression is necessary for selection of patients appropriate for PERJETA therapy because these are the only patients studied and for whom benefit has been shown [see  Indications and Usage (1)  and  Clinical Studies (14)  ]  . Patients with breast cancer were required to have evidence of HER2 overexpression defined as 3+ IHC or FISH amplification ratio >= 2.0 in the clinical studies. Only limited data were available for patients whose breast cancer was positive by FISH, but did not demonstrate protein overexpression by IHC.\n\n\n\n Assessment of HER2 status should be performed by laboratories using FDA-approved tests with demonstrated proficiency in the specific technology being utilized. Improper assay performance, including use of sub-optimally fixed tissue, failure to utilize specified reagents, deviation from specific assay instructions, and failure to include appropriate controls for assay validation, can lead to unreliable results.\n",

(  5.8  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis\n\n\n\n  Pneumonitis occurred in 12 (2.9%) of 411 melanoma patients, including Grade 2 or 3 cases in 8 (1.9%) and 1 (0.2%) patients, respectively, receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The median time to development of pneumonitis was 5 months (range 0.3 weeks to 9.9 months). The median duration was 4.9 months (range 1 week to 14.4 months). Five of eight patients with Grade 2 and the one patient with Grade 3 pneumonitis required initial treatment with high-dose systemic corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper. The median initial dose of high-dose corticosteroid treatment was 63.4 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent with a median duration of treatment of 3 days (range 1 to 34) followed by a corticosteroid taper. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 3 (0.7%) patients. Pneumonitis completely resolved in seven of the nine patients with Grade 2-3 pneumonitis.\n\n\n\n Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate patients with suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging and administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) pneumonitis, and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) pneumonitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.2 Immune-Mediated Colitis\n\n\n\n  Colitis (including microscopic colitis) occurred in 4 (1%) of 411 patients, including Grade 2 or 3 cases in 1 (0.2%) and 2 (0.5%) patients, respectively, receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The median time to onset of colitis was 6.5 months (range 2.3 to 9.8). The median duration was 2.6 months (range 0.6 weeks to 3.6 months). All three patients with Grade 2 or 3 colitis were treated with high-dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) with a median initial dose of 70 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; the median duration of initial treatment was 7 days (range 4 to 41), followed by a corticosteroid taper. One patient (0.2%) required permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA due to colitis. All four patients with colitis experienced complete resolution of the event.\n\n\n\n Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) colitis, and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for life-threatening (Grade 4) colitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.3 Immune-Mediated Hepatitis\n\n\n\n  Hepatitis (including autoimmune hepatitis) occurred in 2 (0.5%) of 411 patients, including a Grade 4 case in 1 (0.2%) patient, receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The time to onset was 22 days for the case of Grade 4 hepatitis which lasted 1.1 months. The patient with Grade 4 hepatitis permanently discontinued KEYTRUDA and was treated with high-dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) systemic corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper. Both patients with hepatitis experienced complete resolution of the event.\n\n\n\n Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies\n\n\n\n    Hypophysitis    \n\n\n\n  Hypophysitis occurred in 2 (0.5%) of 411 patients, consisting of one Grade 2 and one Grade 4 case (0.2% each), in patients receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The time to onset was 1.7 months for the patient with Grade 4 hypophysitis and 1.3 months for the patient with Grade 2 hypophysitis. Both patients were treated with high-dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper and remained on a physiologic replacement dose.  \n\n\n\n  Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hypophysitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) hypophysitis, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) hypophysitis, and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for life-threatening (Grade 4) hypophysitis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].    \n\n\n\n     Thyroid Disorders    \n\n\n\n  Hyperthyroidism occurred in 5 (1.2%) of 411 patients, including Grade 2 or 3 cases in 2 (0.5%) and 1 (0.2%) patients, respectively, receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The median time to onset was 1.5 months (range 0.5 to 2.1). The median duration was 2.8 months (range 0.9 to 6.1). One of two patients with Grade 2 and the one patient with Grade 3 hyperthyroidism required initial treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper. One patient (0.2%) required permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA due to hyperthyroidism. All five patients with hyperthyroidism experienced complete resolution of the event.  \n\n\n\n  Hypothyroidism occurred in 34 (8.3%) of 411 patients, including a Grade 3 case in 1 (0.2%) patient, receiving KEYTRUDA in Trial 1. The median time to onset of hypothyroidism was 3.5 months (range 0.7 weeks to 19 months). All but two of the patients with hypothyroidism were treated with long-term thyroid hormone replacement therapy. The other two patients only required short-term thyroid hormone replacement therapy. No patient received corticosteroids or discontinued KEYTRUDA for management of hypothyroidism.  \n\n\n\n  Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.  \n\n\n\n  Administer corticosteroids for Grade 3 or greater hyperthyroidism, withhold KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3) hyperthyroidism, and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for life-threatening (Grade 4) hyperthyroidism. Isolated hypothyroidism may be managed with replacement therapy without treatment interruption and without corticosteroids [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].    \n\n\n\n     Type 1 Diabetes mellitus    \n\n\n\n  Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, has occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia and other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA in cases of severe hyperglycemia until metabolic control is achieved [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].    \n\n\n\n    5.5 Renal Failure and Immune-Mediated Nephritis\n\n\n\n  Nephritis occurred in 3 (0.7%) patients, consisting of one case of Grade 2 autoimmune nephritis (0.2%) and two cases of interstitial nephritis with renal failure (0.5%), one Grade 3 and one Grade 4. The time to onset of autoimmune nephritis was 11.6 months after the first dose of KEYTRUDA (5 months after the last dose) and lasted 3.2 months; this patient did not have a biopsy. Acute interstitial nephritis was confirmed by renal biopsy in two patients with Grades 3-4 renal failure. All three patients fully recovered renal function with treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper.\n\n\n\n Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for moderate (Grade 2) nephritis, and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for severe (Grade 3), or life-threatening (Grade 4) nephritis [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.6 Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions\n\n\n\n  Other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur.\n\n\n\n The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with KEYTRUDA in Trial 1: exfoliative dermatitis, uveitis, arthritis, myositis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma.\n\n\n\n  Across clinical studies with KEYTRUDA, the following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions have occurred: severe dermatitis including bullous pemphigoid, myasthenic syndrome, optic neuritis, and rhabdomyolysis.  \n\n\n\n  For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Restart KEYTRUDA if the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any severe or Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and  Adverse Reactions (6.1)  ].    \n\n\n\n    5.7 Infusion-Related Reactions\n\n\n\n   Infusion-related reactions, including severe and life-threatening reactions, have occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritis, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA [see  Dosage and Administration (2.2)  ]  .  \n\n\n\n    5.8 Embryofetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal models link the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway with maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA [see  Use in Specific Populations (8.1  ,  8.8)  ].  \n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Anti-metreleptin antibodies with neutralizing activity: Could inhibit endogenous leptin action and/or result in loss of MYALEPT efficacy. Test for neutralizing antibodies in patients with severe infections or loss of efficacy during MYALEPT treatment. (  5.1  ) \n *  T-cell lymphoma: Carefully consider benefits and risks of treatment with MYALEPT in patients with significant hematologic abnormalities and/or acquired generalized lipodystrophy. (  5.2  ) \n *  Hypoglycemia: A dose adjustment, including possible large reductions, of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be necessary. Closely monitor blood glucose in patients on concomitant insulin or insulin secretagogue therapy. (  5.4  ) \n *  Autoimmunity: Autoimmune disorder progression has been observed in patients treated with MYALEPT. Carefully consider benefits and risks of MYALEPT treatment in patients with autoimmune disease. (  5.5  ) \n *  Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, urticaria or generalized rash) have been reported. Patient should promptly seek medical advice regarding suspected reactions. (  5.6  ) \n *  Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Preservative-free sterile WFI recommended for neonates and infants. (  5.7  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Risk for Development of Antibodies that Neutralize Endogenous Leptin and/or MYALEPT\n\n\n\n  Anti-metreleptin antibodies with in vitro  neutralizing activity to leptin associated with adverse events consistent with loss of endogenous leptin activity and/or loss of efficacy have been identified in two patients with generalized lipodystrophy treated with MYALEPT (severe infections, increases in HbA1cand triglycerides), and in three patients without lipodystrophy who received MYALEPT in clinical studies (excessive weight gain, development of glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus). The clinical implications associated with development of anti-metreleptin antibodies with neutralizing activity are not well characterized at this time due to the small number of reports. Test for anti-metreleptin antibodies with neutralizing activity in patients who develop severe infections or show signs suspicious for loss of MYALEPT efficacy during treatment. Contact Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-216-1526 for neutralizing antibody testing of clinical samples [see   Adverse Reactions (6.2)    ].\n\n\n\n    5.2 Lymphoma\n\n\n\n  Three cases of T-cell lymphoma have been reported in the MYALEPT lipodystrophy program; all three patients had acquired generalized lipodystrophy. Two of these patients were diagnosed with peripheral T-cell lymphoma while receiving MYALEPT. Both had immunodeficiency and significant hematologic abnormalities including severe bone marrow abnormalities before the start of MYALEPT treatment. A separate case of anaplastic large cell lymphoma was reported in a patient receiving MYALEPT who did not have hematological abnormalities before treatment.\n\n\n\n Lymphoproliferative disorders, including lymphomas, have been reported in patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy not treated with MYALEPT. A causal relationship between MYALEPT treatment and the development and/or progression of lymphoma has not been established. Acquired lipodystrophies are associated with autoimmune disorders, and autoimmune disorders are associated with an increased risk of malignancies including lymphomas.\n\n\n\n The benefits and risks of MYALEPT treatment should be carefully considered in patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy and/or those with significant hematologic abnormalities (including leukopenia, neutropenia, bone marrow abnormalities, lymphoma, and/or lymphadenopathy).\n\n\n\n    5.3 MYALEPT REMS Program\n\n\n\n  MYALEPT is available only through a restricted distribution program under a REMS, called the MYALEPT REMS Program, because of the risks associated with the development of anti-metreleptin antibodies that neutralize endogenous leptin and/or MYALEPT and the risk for lymphoma [see   Warnings and Precautions (5.1,    5.2)    ].\n\n\n\n Notable requirements of the MYALEPT REMS Program include the following:\n\n\n\n *  Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training. \n *  Pharmacies must be certified with the program and only dispense MYALEPT after receipt of the MYALEPT REMS Prescription Authorization Form for each new prescription. \n    Further information is available at www.myaleptrems.com  or 1-855-6MYALEPT.\n \n\n    5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\n\n\n  Dosage adjustments, including possible large reductions, of insulin or insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) may be necessary in some patients to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia [see   Dosage and Administration (2.4)    and   Adverse Reactions (6.1)    ]. Closely monitor blood glucose in patients on concomitant insulin therapy, especially those on high doses, or insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea), when treating with MYALEPT.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Autoimmunity\n\n\n\n  Leptin plays a role in immune system homeostasis. Acquired lipodystrophies are associated with autoimmune disorders including autoimmune hepatitis and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Cases of progression of autoimmune hepatitis and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (associated with massive proteinuria and renal failure) were observed in some patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy treated with MYALEPT. A causal relationship between MYALEPT treatment and the development and/or progression of autoimmune disease has not been established. The potential benefits and risks of MYALEPT treatment should be carefully considered in patients with autoimmune disease.\n\n\n\n    5.6 Hypersensitivity\n\n\n\n  There have been reports of generalized hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis, urticaria or generalized rash) in patients taking MYALEPT. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, instruct the patient to promptly seek medical advice regarding discontinuation of MYALEPT.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity\n\n\n\n  MYALEPT contains benzyl alcohol when reconstituted with BWFI. MYALEPT contains no preservative when reconstituted with sterile Water for Injection (WFI). Preservative-free WFI is recommended for use in neonates and infants. The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in pediatric patients, particularly in neonates and premature infants [see   Use in Specific Populations (8.4)    ].\n",

If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue TRADJENTA.  (5.1)   \n *  When used with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin, consider lowering the dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia  (5.2)   \n *  There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with TRADJENTA including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. In such cases, promptly discontinue TRADJENTA, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment, and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes.  (5.3)   \n *  Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate.  (5.4)   \n *  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with TRADJENTA or any other antidiabetic drug  (5.5)   \n    \n \n\n   5.1  Pancreatitis\n\n\n\n  There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis, in patients taking TRADJENTA. Take careful notice of potential signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue TRADJENTA and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using TRADJENTA.\n\n\n\n    5.2  Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia\n\n\n\n  Insulin secretagogues and insulin are known to cause hypoglycemia. The use of TRADJENTA in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) was associated with a higher rate of hypoglycemia compared with placebo in a clinical trial [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . The use of TRADJENTA in combination with insulin in subjects with severe renal impairment was associated with a higher rate of hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (  6.1  )]  . Therefore, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with TRADJENTA.\n\n\n\n    5.3  Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n  There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with TRADJENTA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with TRADJENTA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue TRADJENTA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes.\n\n\n\n Angioedema has also been reported with other dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with TRADJENTA.\n\n\n\n    5.4  Severe and Disabling Arthralgia\n\n\n\n   There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate.  \n\n\n\n    5.5  Macrovascular Outcomes\n\n\n\n  There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with TRADJENTA tablets or any other antidiabetic drug.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Serotonin Syndrome has been reported with serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, and others), including with BRINTELLIX, both when taken alone, but especially when co-administered with other serotonergic agents (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort). If such symptoms occur, discontinue BRINTELLIX and initiate supportive treatment. If concomitant use of BRINTELLIX with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases (  5.2  ). \n *    Treatment with serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, and others) may increase the risk of abnormal bleeding. Patients should be cautioned about the increased risk of bleeding when BRINTELLIX is coadministered with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation (  5.3  ). \n *    Activation of Mania/Hypomania can occur with antidepressant treatment. Screen patients for bipolar disorder (  5.4  ). \n *    Angle Closure Glaucoma: Angle closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants (  5.5  ). \n *    Hyponatremia can occur in association with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) (  5.6  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk\n\n\n\n  Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled studies of antidepressant drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a trend toward reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.\n\n\n\n The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled studies in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term studies of nine antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled studies in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term studies (median duration of two months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1  .\n\n\n\n\n  Table 1. Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated    \n  Age Range                                                                                         \n  Increases Compared to Placebo          \n  <18                                    14 additional cases                                        \n  18-24                                  5 additional cases                                         \n  Decreases Compared to Placebo          \n  25-64                                  1 fewer case                                               \n  >=65                                   6 fewer cases                                              \n        No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric studies. There were suicides in the adult studies, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\n \n\n It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance studies in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.\n\n\n\n  All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.  \n\n\n\n The following symptoms anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.\n\n\n\n Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.\n\n\n\n  Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for MDD or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.  \n\n\n\n  Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder  \n\n\n\n A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled studies) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that BRINTELLIX is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Serotonin Syndrome\n\n\n\n  The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with serotonergic antidepressants including BRINTELLIX, when used alone but more often when used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort), and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).\n\n\n\n Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.\n\n\n\n The concomitant use of BRINTELLIX with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. BRINTELLIX should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with a MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking BRINTELLIX. BRINTELLIX should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see  Contraindications (4)      and  Dosage and Administration (2.4)  ]  .\n\n\n\n If concomitant use of BRINTELLIX with other serotonergic drugs, including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.\n\n\n\n Treatment with BRINTELLIX and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Abnormal Bleeding\n\n\n\n  The use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including BRINTELLIX, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that inhibit serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.\n\n\n\n Patients should be cautioned about the increased risk of bleeding when BRINTELLIX is coadministered with NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation or bleeding [see  Drug Interactions (7.2)  ].  \n\n\n\n    5.4 Activation of Mania/Hypomania\n\n\n\n  Symptoms of mania/hypomania were reported in <0.1% of patients treated with BRINTELLIX in pre-marketing clinical studies. Activation of mania/hypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder who were treated with other antidepressants. As with all antidepressants, use BRINTELLIX cautiously in patients with a history or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Angle Closure Glaucoma\n\n\n\n   Angle Closure Glaucoma: The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs, including BRINTELLIX, may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.  \n\n\n\n    5.6 Hyponatremia\n\n\n\n  Hyponatremia has occurred as a result of treatment with serotonergic drugs. In many cases, hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). One case with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L was reported in a subject treated with BRINTELLIX in a pre-marketing clinical study. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with a serotonergic antidepressant. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume-depleted can be at greater risk. Discontinuation of BRINTELLIX in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. More severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Elimination of AUBAGIO can be accelerated by administration of cholestyramine or activated charcoal for 11 days (  5.3  ) \n *  AUBAGIO may decrease WBC. A recent CBC should be available before starting AUBAGIO. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Consider suspending treatment with AUBAGIO in case of serious infection. Do not start AUBAGIO in patients with active infections (  5.4  ) \n *  If patient develops symptoms consistent with peripheral neuropathy, evaluate patient and consider discontinuing AUBAGIO (  5.5  ) \n *  Stop AUBAGIO if patient develops Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (  5.6  ) \n *  AUBAGIO may increase blood pressure. Measure blood pressure at treatment initiation and monitor blood pressure during treatment (  5.7  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Hepatotoxicity\n\n\n\n  Severe liver injury including fatal liver failure and dysfunction has been reported in some patients treated with leflunomide, which is indicated for rheumatoid arthritis. A similar risk would be expected for teriflunomide because recommended doses of teriflunomide and leflunomide result in a similar range of plasma concentrations of teriflunomide. Patients with pre-existing liver disease may be at increased risk of developing elevated serum transaminases when taking AUBAGIO. Patients with pre-existing acute or chronic liver disease, or those with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than two times the upper limit of normal (ULN) before initiating treatment, should not normally be treated with AUBAGIO. AUBAGIO is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see  Contraindications (4.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n  In placebo-controlled trials, ALT greater than three times the ULN occurred in 61/1045 (5.8%) and 62/1002 (6.2%) of patients receiving AUBAGIO 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, and 38/997 (3.8%) of patients receiving placebo, during the treatment period. These elevations occurred mostly within the first year of treatment. Half of the cases returned to normal without drug discontinuation. In clinical trials, if ALT elevation was greater than three times the ULN on two consecutive tests, AUBAGIO was discontinued and patients underwent an accelerated elimination procedure [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  . Of the patients who underwent discontinuation and accelerated elimination in controlled trials, half returned to normal or near normal values within 2 months.  \n\n\n\n One patient in the controlled trials developed ALT 32 times the ULN and jaundice 5 months after initiation of AUBAGIO 14 mg treatment. The patient was hospitalized for 5 weeks and recovered after plasmapheresis and cholestyramine accelerated elimination procedure. AUBAGIO-induced liver injury in this patient could not be ruled out.\n\n\n\n Obtain serum transaminase and bilirubin levels within 6 months before initiation of AUBAGIO therapy. Monitor ALT levels at least monthly for six months after starting AUBAGIO. Consider additional monitoring when AUBAGIO is given with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Consider discontinuing AUBAGIO if serum transaminase increase (greater than three times the ULN) is confirmed. Monitor serum transaminase and bilirubin on AUBAGIO therapy, particularly in patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine. If liver injury is suspected to be AUBAGIO-induced, discontinue AUBAGIO and start an accelerated elimination procedure [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized. If AUBAGIO-induced liver injury is unlikely because some other probable cause has been found, resumption of AUBAGIO therapy may be considered.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Use in Women of Childbearing Potential\n\n\n\n  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies evaluating AUBAGIO in pregnant women. However, based on animal studies, teriflunomide may increase the risk of teratogenic effects or fetal death when administered to a pregnant woman [see  Contraindications (4.2)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Women of childbearing potential must not be started on AUBAGIO until pregnancy is excluded and it has been confirmed that they are using reliable contraception. Before starting treatment with AUBAGIO, patients must be fully counseled on the potential for serious risk to the fetus. The patient must be advised that if there is any delay in onset of menses or any other reason to suspect pregnancy, they must notify the physician immediately for pregnancy testing and, if positive, the physician and patient must discuss the risk to the fetus. It is possible that rapidly lowering the plasma concentration of teriflunomide by instituting an accelerated elimination procedure may decrease the risk to the fetus from AUBAGIO [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n Upon discontinuing AUBAGIO, it is recommended that all women of childbearing potential undergo an accelerated elimination procedure. Women receiving AUBAGIO treatment who wish to become pregnant must discontinue AUBAGIO and undergo an accelerated elimination procedure, which includes verification of teriflunomide plasma concentrations less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL). Human plasma concentrations of teriflunomide less than 0.02 mg/L (0.02 mcg/mL) are expected to have minimal risk [see  Contraindications (4.2)  ,  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  and  Use in Specific Populations (8.1)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.3 Procedure for Accelerated Elimination of Teriflunomide\n\n\n\n  Teriflunomide is eliminated slowly from the plasma. Without an accelerated elimination procedure, it takes on average 8 months to reach plasma concentrations less than 0.02 mg/L, although because of individual variations in drug clearance it may take as long as 2 years. An accelerated elimination procedure could be used at any time after discontinuation of AUBAGIO. Elimination can be accelerated by either of the following procedures:\n\n\n\n *  Administration of cholestyramine 8 g every 8 hours for 11 days. If cholestyramine 8 g three times a day is not well tolerated, cholestyramine 4 g three times a day can be used. \n *  Administration of 50 g oral activated charcoal powder every 12 hours for 11 days. \n    If either elimination procedure is poorly tolerated, treatment days do not need to be consecutive unless there is a need to lower teriflunomide plasma concentration rapidly.\n \n\n At the end of 11 days, both regimens successfully accelerated teriflunomide elimination, leading to more than 98% decrease in teriflunomide plasma concentrations.\n\n\n\n Use of the accelerated elimination procedure may potentially result in return of disease activity if the patient had been responding to AUBAGIO treatment.\n\n\n\n    5.4 Bone Marrow Effects/Immunosuppression Potential/Infections\n\n\n\n   White Blood Cell (WBC) count decrease  \n\n\n\n  A mean decrease in white blood cell (WBC) count of approximately 15% (mainly neutrophils and lymphocytes) and in platelet count of approximately 10% was observed in placebo-controlled trials with 7 mg and 14 mg of AUBAGIO compared to baseline. The decrease in mean WBC count occurred during the first 6 weeks and WBC count remained low during treatment. In placebo-controlled studies, neutrophil count < 1.5*10  9  /L was observed in 12% and 16% of patients receiving AUBAGIO 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, compared with 7% of patients receiving placebo; lymphocyte count <0.8*10  9  /L was observed in 10% and 12% of patients receiving AUBAGIO 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, compared with 6% of patients receiving placebo. No cases of serious pancytopenia were reported in premarketing clinical trials of AUBAGIO but rare cases of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting with leflunomide. A similar risk would be expected for AUBAGIO [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . Obtain a complete blood cell count (CBC) within 6 months before the initiation of treatment with AUBAGIO. Further monitoring should be based on signs and symptoms suggestive of bone marrow suppression.  \n\n\n\n    Risk of Infection / Tuberculosis Screening  \n\n\n\n Patients with active acute or chronic infections should not start treatment until the infection(s) is resolved. If a patient develops a serious infection consider suspending treatment with AUBAGIO and using an accelerated elimination procedure. Reassess the benefits and risks prior to resumption of therapy. Instruct patients receiving AUBAGIO to report symptoms of infections to a physician.\n\n\n\n AUBAGIO is not recommended for patients with severe immunodeficiency, bone marrow disease, or severe, uncontrolled infections. Medications like AUBAGIO that have immunosuppression potential may cause patients to be more susceptible to infections, including opportunistic infections.\n\n\n\n  In placebo-controlled studies of AUBAGIO, no overall increase in the risk of serious infections was observed with AUBAGIO 7 mg (2.2%) or 14 mg (2.7%) compared to placebo (2.2%). However, one fatal case of klebsiella pneumonia sepsis occurred in a patient taking AUBAGIO 14 mg for 1.7 years. Fatal infections have been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients receiving leflunomide, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia and aspergillosis. Most of the reports were confounded by concomitant immunosuppressant therapy and/or comorbid illness which, in addition to rheumatoid disease, may predispose patients to infection. In clinical studies with AUBAGIO, cytomegalovirus hepatitis reactivation has been observed.  \n\n\n\n  In clinical studies with AUBAGIO, cases of tuberculosis have been observed. Prior to initiating AUBAGIO, screen patients for latent tuberculosis infection with a tuberculin skin test or with a blood test for mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. AUBAGIO has not been studied in patients with a positive tuberculosis screen, and the safety of AUBAGIO in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection is unknown. For patients testing positive in tuberculosis screening, treat by standard medical practice prior to therapy with AUBAGIO.  \n\n\n\n    Vaccination  \n\n\n\n No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of live vaccinations in patients taking AUBAGIO. Vaccination with live vaccines is not recommended. The long half-life of AUBAGIO should be considered when contemplating administration of a live vaccine after stopping AUBAGIO.\n\n\n\n    Malignancy  \n\n\n\n The risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders, is increased with the use of some immunosuppressive medications. There is a potential for immunosuppression with AUBAGIO. No apparent increase in the incidence of malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders was reported in the AUBAGIO clinical trials, but larger and longer-term studies would be needed to determine whether there is an increased risk of malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorders with AUBAGIO.\n\n\n\n    5.5 Peripheral Neuropathy\n\n\n\n   In placebo-controlled studies, peripheral neuropathy, including both polyneuropathy and mononeuropathy (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome), occurred more frequently in patients taking AUBAGIO than in patients taking placebo. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy confirmed by nerve conduction studies was 1.4% (13 patients) and 1.9% (17 patients) of patients receiving 7 mg and 14 mg of AUBAGIO, respectively, compared with 0.4% receiving placebo (4 patients). Treatment was discontinued in 0.7% (8 patients) with confirmed peripheral neuropathy (3 patients receiving AUBAGIO 7 mg and 5 patients receiving AUBAGIO 14 mg). Five of them recovered following treatment discontinuation. Not all cases of peripheral neuropathy resolved with continued treatment. Peripheral neuropathy also occurred in patients receiving leflunomide.  \n\n\n\n Age older than 60 years, concomitant neurotoxic medications, and diabetes may increase the risk for peripheral neuropathy .  If a patient taking AUBAGIO develops symptoms consistent with peripheral neuropathy, such as bilateral numbness or tingling of hands or feet, consider discontinuing AUBAGIO therapy and performing an accelerated elimination procedure [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.6 Skin Reactions\n\n\n\n  Rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving leflunomide. A similar risk would be expected for AUBAGIO [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . If a patient taking AUBAGIO develops any of these conditions, stop AUBAGIO therapy and perform an accelerated elimination procedure [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.7 Increased Blood Pressure\n\n\n\n   In placebo-controlled studies, the mean change from baseline to the end of study in systolic blood pressure was +2.3 mmHg and +2.7 mmHg for AUBAGIO 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, and -0.6 mmHg for placebo. The change from baseline in diastolic blood pressure was +1.4 mmHg and +1.9 mmHg for AUBAGIO 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, and -0.3 mmHg for placebo. Hypertension was an adverse reaction in 3.1% and 4.3% of patients treated with 7 mg or 14 mg of AUBAGIO compared with 1.8% for placebo. Check blood pressure before start of AUBAGIO treatment and periodically thereafter. Elevated blood pressure should be appropriately managed during treatment with AUBAGIO.  \n\n\n\n    5.8 Respiratory Effects\n\n\n\n  Interstitial lung disease and worsening of pre-existing interstitial lung disease have been reported during treatment with leflunomide. A similar risk would be expected for AUBAGIO [see  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)  ]  . Interstitial lung disease may be fatal. Interstitial lung disease may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has a variable clinical presentation. New onset or worsening pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnea, with or without associated fever, may be a reason for discontinuation of the therapy and for further investigation as appropriate. If discontinuation of the drug is necessary, consider initiation of an accelerated elimination procedure [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .\n\n\n\n    5.9 Concomitant Use with Immunosuppressive or Immunomodulating Therapies\n\n\n\n  Co-administration with antineoplastic, or immunosuppressive therapies used for treatment of multiple sclerosis has not been evaluated. Safety studies in which AUBAGIO was concomitantly administered with other immune modulating therapies for up to one year (interferon beta, glatiramer acetate) did not reveal any specific safety concerns. The long term safety of these combinations in the treatment of multiple sclerosis has not been established.\n\n\n\n In any situation in which the decision is made to switch from AUBAGIO to another agent with a known potential for hematologic suppression, it would be prudent to monitor for hematologic toxicity, because there will be overlap of systemic exposure to both compounds. Use of an accelerated elimination procedure may decrease this risk, but may also potentially result in return of disease activity if the patient had been responding to AUBAGIO treatment [see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)  ]  .\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *  Hematologic Toxicity: Neutropenia was the most frequently reported Grade 3/4 adverse event. Monitor patients for hematologic toxicities, especially neutropenia (  5.4  ). \n *  Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic failure including fatalities; monitor liver function tests monthly (  5.5  ). \n *  Hypersensitivity Reactions: Angioedema and severe dermatologic reactions have been reported. Discontinue POMALYST for angioedema and severe dermatologic reactions (  5.6  ). \n *  Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Monitor patients at risk of TLS (i.e., those with high tumor burden) and take appropriate precautions (  5.10  ). \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity\n\n\n\n  POMALYST is a thalidomide analogue and is contraindicated for use during pregnancy. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes severe birth defects or embryo-fetal death [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.1  )  ]. POMALYST is only available through the POMALYST REMS program [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.2  )  ].\n\n\n\n  Females of Reproductive Potential  Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy while taking POMALYST and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy.\n\n\n\n Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control, beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with POMALYST, during therapy, during dose interruptions, and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of POMALYST therapy.\n\n\n\n Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy. The first test should be performed within 10-14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing POMALYST therapy and then weekly during the first month, then monthly thereafter in women with regular menstrual cycles, or every 2 weeks in women with irregular menstrual cycles [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )  ].\n\n\n\n  Males  Pomalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking POMALYST and for up to 28 days after discontinuing POMALYST, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking POMALYST must not donate sperm [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  )  ].\n\n\n\n  Blood Donation  Patients must not donate blood during treatment with POMALYST and for 1 month following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to POMALYST.\n\n\n\n    5.2 POMALYST REMS Program\n\n\n\n  Because of the embryo-fetal risk [see Warnings and Precautions (  5.1  )  ], POMALYST is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called \" POMALYST REMS  .\"\n\n\n\n Required components of the POMALYST REMS  program include the following:\n\n\n\n *  Prescribers must be certified with the POMALYST REMS program by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements. \n *  Patients must sign a Patient-Physician Agreement Form and comply with the REMS requirements. In particular, female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) ] and males must comply with contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (  8.6  ) ]. \n *  Pharmacies must be certified with the POMALYST REMS program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive POMALYST, and comply with REMS requirements. \n    Further information about the POMALYST REMS  program is available at www.CelgeneRiskManagement.com or by telephone at 1-888-423-5436.\n \n\n     5.3 Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism  \n\n\n\n   Venous thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction and stroke) have been observed in patients treated with POMALYST. In Trial 2, where anticoagulant therapies were mandated, thromboembolic events occurred in 8.0% of patients treated with POMALYST and low dose-dexamethasone (Low-dose Dex), and 3.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone. Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) occurred in 4.7% of patients treated with POMALYST and Low-dose Dex, and 1.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone. Arterial thromboembolic events include terms for arterial thromboembolic events, ischemic cerebrovascular conditions, and ischemic heart disease. Arterial thromboembolic events occurred in 3.0% of patients treated with POMALYST and Low-dose Dex, and 1.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone.  \n\n\n\n  Patients with known risk factors, including prior thrombosis, may be at greater risk, and actions should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable factors (e.g., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking). Thromboprophylaxis is recommended, and the choice of regimen should be based on assessment of the patient's underlying risk factors.  \n\n\n\n     5.4 Hematologic Toxicity  \n\n\n\n   In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received POMALYST + Low-dose Dex, neutropenia was the most frequently reported Grade 3/4 adverse reaction, followed by anemia and thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia of any grade was reported in 51% of patients in both trials. The rate of Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 46%. The rate of febrile neutropenia was 8%.  \n\n\n\n Monitor patients for hematologic toxicities, especially neutropenia. Monitor complete blood counts weekly for the first 8 weeks and monthly thereafter. Patients may require dose interruption and/or modification [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )  ].\n\n\n\n     5.5 Hepatotoxicity  \n\n\n\n   Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has occurred in patients treated with POMALYST. Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin have also been observed in patients treated with POMALYST. Monitor liver function tests monthly. Stop POMALYST upon elevation of liver enzymes and evaluate. After return to baseline values, treatment at a lower dose may be considered.  \n\n\n\n    5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions\n\n\n\n   Angioedema and severe dermatologic reactions have been reported. Discontinue POMALYST for angioedema, skin exfoliation, bullae, or any other severe dermatologic reactions, and do not resume therapy [see Dosage and Administration (  2.2  )  ].  \n\n\n\n     5.7 Dizziness and Confusional State  \n\n\n\n   In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received POMALYST + Low-dose Dex, 14% of patients experienced dizziness and 7% of patients experienced a confusional state; 1% of patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 dizziness, and 3% of patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 confusional state. Instruct patients to avoid situations where dizziness or confusional state may be a problem and not to take other medications that may cause dizziness or confusional state without adequate medical advice.  \n\n\n\n     5.8 Neuropathy  \n\n\n\n   In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received POMALYST + Low-dose Dex, 18% of patients experienced neuropathy, with approximately 12% of the patients experiencing peripheral neuropathy. Two percent of patients experienced Grade 3 neuropathy in trial 2. There were no cases of Grade 4 neuropathy adverse reactions reported in either trial.  \n\n\n\n    5.9 Risk of Second Primary Malignancies\n\n\n\n  Cases of acute myelogenous leukemia have been reported in patients receiving POMALYST as an investigational therapy outside of multiple myeloma.\n\n\n\n    5.10 Tumor Lysis Syndrome\n\n\n\n   Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) may occur in patients treated with pomalidomide. Patients at risk for TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions taken.  \n",

(5.1)   \n *  Administration-Related Adverse Reactions: If adverse reactions including bradycardia, oxygen desaturation, reflux of SURFAXIN into the endotracheal tube (ETT), and airway/ETT obstruction occur during administration of SURFAXIN, dosing should be interrupted and the infant's clinical condition assessed and stabilized. Suctioning of the ETT or reintubation may be required if airway obstruction persists or is severe.  (5.2)   \n *  Increased Serious Adverse Reactions in Adults with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Adults with ARDS who received lucinactant via segmental bronchoscopic lavage had an increased incidence of death, multi-organ failure, sepsis, anoxic encephalopathy, renal failure, hypoxia, pneumothorax, hypotension, and pulmonary embolism. SURFAXIN is not indicated for use in ARDS.  (5.3)   \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Acute Changes in Lung Compliance\n\n\n\n  Administration of exogenous surfactants, including SURFAXIN, can rapidly affect lung compliance and oxygenation. SURFAXIN should be administered only by clinicians trained and experienced in the resuscitation, intubation, stabilization, and ventilatory management of premature infants in a clinical setting with the capacity to care for critically ill neonates. Infants receiving SURFAXIN should receive frequent clinical assessments so that oxygen and ventilatory support can be modified to respond to changes in respiratory status.\n\n\n\n    5.2 Administration-Related Adverse Reactions\n\n\n\n  Frequently occurring adverse reactions related to the administration of SURFAXIN include bradycardia, oxygen desaturation, reflux of drug into the endotracheal tube (ETT), and airway/ETT obstruction. If any of these events occur, dosing with SURFAXIN should be interrupted and the infant's clinical condition assessed and stabilized. Suctioning of the ETT or reintubation may be required if airway obstruction persists or is severe. After the patient is stable, dosing may proceed with appropriate monitoring.\n\n\n\n    5.3 Increased Serious Adverse Reactions in Adults with ARDS\n\n\n\n  In a two-part clinical trial in adult patients with ARDS, compared to standard of care, patients who received lucinactant via segmental bronchoscopic lavage had an increased incidence of death, multi-organ failure, sepsis, anoxic encephalopathy, renal failure, hypoxia, pneumothorax, hypotension, and pulmonary embolism. SURFAXIN is not indicated for use in the treatment of ARDS.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n   EXCERPT:    *    Infusion Reactions: Premedicate with corticosteroid, acetaminophen, and an antihistamine. Monitor patients during infusions. Interrupt infusion if infusion reactions occur. (  2.3  ,  2.4  ,  5.1  ) \n *    Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Anticipate TLS in high-risk patients; premedicate with anti-hyperuricemics and hydration. (  5.5  ) \n *    Cytopenias: Neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occur. Late-onset and prolonged neutropenia can also occur. Monitor complete blood counts at regular intervals. (  5.6  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Infusion Reactions\n\n\n\n  ARZERRA can cause serious, including fatal, infusion reactions manifesting as bronchospasm, dyspnea, laryngeal edema, pulmonary edema, flushing, hypertension, hypotension, syncope, cardiac events (e.g., myocardial ischemia/infarction, acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, bradycardia), back pain, abdominal pain, pyrexia, rash, urticaria, angioedema, cytokine release syndrome, and anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions. Infusion reactions occur more frequently with the first 2 infusions. These reactions may result in temporary interruption or withdrawal of treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]  .\n\n\n\n Premedicate with acetaminophen, an antihistamine, and a corticosteroid [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4)]  . Infusion reactions may occur despite premedication. Interrupt infusion with ARZERRA for infusion reactions of any severity. Institute medical management for severe infusion reactions including angina or other signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]  . If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, immediately and permanently discontinue ARZERRA and initiate appropriate medical treatment.\n\n\n\n     5.2 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation  \n\n\n\n   Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, has occurred in patients treated with ARZERRA. Cases have been reported in patients who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and also in patients who are HBsAg negative but are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive. Reactivation also has occurred in patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection (i.e., HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive, and hepatitis B surface antibody [anti-HBs] positive).  \n\n\n\n  HBV reactivation is defined as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level or detection of HBsAg in a person who was previously HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive. Reactivation of HBV replication is often followed by hepatitis, i.e., increase in transaminase levels and, in severe cases, increase in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death.  \n\n\n\n  Screen all patients for HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating treatment with ARZERRA. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive [regardless of antibody status] or HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive), consult physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for HBV antiviral therapy.  \n\n\n\n  Monitor patients with evidence of current or prior HBV infection for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis or HBV reactivation during and for several months following treatment with ARZERRA. HBV reactivation has been reported for at least 12 months following completion of therapy.  \n\n\n\n  In patients who develop reactivation of HBV while receiving ARZERRA, immediately discontinue ARZERRA and any concomitant chemotherapy, and institute appropriate treatment. Resumption of ARZERRA in patients whose HBV reactivation resolves should be discussed with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B. Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of resuming ARZERRA in patients who develop HBV reactivation.  \n\n\n\n     5.3 Hepatitis B Virus Infection  \n\n\n\n   Fatal infection due to hepatitis B in patients who have not been previously infected has been observed with ARZERRA. Monitor patients for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis.  \n\n\n\n     5.4 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy  \n\n\n\n   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) resulting in death has occurred with ARZERRA. Consider PML in any patient with new onset of or changes in pre-existing neurological signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, discontinue ARZERRA and initiate evaluation for PML including neurology consultation  .\n\n\n\n     5.5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome  \n\n\n\n   Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), including the need for hospitalization, has occurred in patients treated with ARZERRA. Patients with high tumor burden and/or high circulating lymphocyte counts (>25 x 10  9  /L) are at greater risk for developing TLS. Consider tumor lysis prophylaxis with anti-hyperuricemics and hydration beginning 12 to 24 hours prior to infusion of ARZERRA. For treatment of TLS, administer aggressive intravenous hydration and anti-hyperuricemic agents, correct electrolyte abnormalities, and monitor renal function  .\n\n\n\n    5.6 Cytopenias\n\n\n\n  Severe cytopenias, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, can occur with ARZERRA. Pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and fatal neutropenic sepsis have occurred in patients who received ARZERRA in combination with chlorambucil. Grade 3 or 4 late-onset neutropenia (onset at least 42 days after last treatment dose) and/or prolonged neutropenia (not resolved between 24 and 42 days after last treatment dose) were reported in patients who received ARZERRA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].  Monitor complete blood counts at regular intervals during and after conclusion of therapy, and increase the frequency of monitoring in patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias.\n\n\n\n    5.7 Immunizations\n\n\n\n  The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following administration of ARZERRA has not been studied. Do not administer live viral vaccines to patients who have recently received ARZERRA. The ability to generate an immune response to any vaccine following administration of ARZERRA has not been studied.\n",

        "section_text": "    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n\n\n     EXCERPT:    *  Elevated liver enzymes: ALT, AST, and bilirubin elevations have occurred with ESBRIET. Monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin before and during treatment. Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations may be required. (  2.1  ,  5.1  ) \n *  Photosensitivity and rash: Photosensitivity and rash have been noted with ESBRIET. Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen and protective clothing daily. Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations may be required. (  5.2  ) \n *  Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and abdominal pain have occurred with ESBRIET. Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations may be required. (  5.3  ) \n    \n \n\n   5.1 Elevated Liver Enzymes\n\n\n\n  Increases in ALT and AST >3 * ULN have been reported in patients treated with ESBRIET. Rarely these have been associated with concomitant elevations in bilirubin. Patients treated with ESBRIET 2403 mg/day in the three Phase 3 trials had a higher incidence of elevations in ALT or AST >=3 * ULN than placebo patients (3.7% vs. 0.8%, respectively). Elevations >=10 * ULN in ALT or AST occurred in 0.3% of patients in the ESBRIET 2403 mg/day group and in 0.2% of patients in the placebo group. Increases in ALT and AST >=3 * ULN were reversible with dose modification or treatment discontinuation. No cases of liver transplant or death due to liver failure that were related to ESBRIET have been reported. However, the combination of transaminase elevations and elevated bilirubin without evidence of obstruction is generally recognized as an important predictor of severe liver injury, that could lead to death or the need for liver transplants in some patients. Conduct liver function tests (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) prior to the initiation of therapy with ESBRIET in all patients, then monthly for the first 6 months and every 3 months thereafter. Dosage modifications or interruption may be necessary for liver enzyme elevations   [see Dosage and Administration (2.1,    2.3)].    \n\n\n\n    5.2 Photosensitivity Reaction or Rash\n\n\n\n  Patients treated with ESBRIET 2403 mg/day in the three Phase 3 studies had a higher incidence of photosensitivity reactions (9%) compared with patients treated with placebo (1%). The majority of the photosensitivity reactions occurred during the initial 6 months. Instruct patients to avoid or minimize exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps), to use a sunblock (SPF 50 or higher), and to wear clothing that protects against sun exposure. Additionally, instruct patients to avoid concomitant medications known to cause photosensitivity. Dosage reduction or discontinuation may be necessary in some cases of photosensitivity reaction or rash   [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]    .\n\n\n\n    5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders\n\n\n\n  In the clinical studies, gastrointestinal events of nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, vomiting, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and abdominal pain were more frequently reported by patients in the ESBRIET treatment groups than in those taking placebo. Dosage reduction or interruption for gastrointestinal events was required in 18.5% of patients in the 2403 mg/day group, as compared to 5.8% of patients in the placebo group; 2.2% of patients in the ESBRIET 2403 mg/day group discontinued treatment due to a gastrointestinal event, as compared to 1.0% in the placebo group. The most common (>2%) gastrointestinal events that led to dosage reduction or interruption were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and dyspepsia. The incidence of gastrointestinal events was highest early in the course of treatment (with highest incidence occurring during the initial 3 months) and decreased over time. Dosage modifications may be necessary in some cases of gastrointestinal adverse reactions   [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]    .\n",
